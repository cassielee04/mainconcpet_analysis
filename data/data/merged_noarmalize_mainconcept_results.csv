Um found and was interested in.,0,1
Taking her back to the castle.,1,0
To be married.,1,0
As far.,0,1
as I know that 's the end.,0,0
OK well there was this family and once upon a time of course it was this family.,1,1
and then in the family there was a so it was a case of a second marriage.,1,1
and mama brought her.,1,1
to Uh pain and their daughters to the household.,1,0
and then there was Cinderella.,1,1
Ella lived in the household.,1,0
and then they came in and were very cruel to her.,1,1
and made her do all the menial tasks and everything like.,1,1
And then finally someone comes along and Is are you there?,0,1
OK.,0,0
Someone comes along from the from the king's palace.,1,1
and says there's going to be a ball that all the young ladies of a certain age are.,1,1
to go.,0,1
so they're getting already the two girls the the daughters in the household are getting all ready.,1,1
to go.,0,1
and they get all their fancy clothes and everything.,1,1
And of course Cinderella isn't even being bothered.,1,1
but a fairy godmother comes along.,1,1
and she gets everything for her and her clothes and everything and beautiful little glass slippers.,1,1
and then she goes to the ball.,1,1
And she goes in a coach that 's really like a huge pumpkin.,1,1
and the the stipulation is she has to be back home.,1,1
I believe it's by midnight.,1,1
before the clock chimes midnight.,1,1
Anyway.,0,0
so she's having a wonderful time.,1,1
and the prince thinks she's really cool.,1,1
and she Oh We lost connection.,0,1
Hang on we lost connection.,0,1
And um when they get to the house where Cinderella is she's not even.,1,1
to be bothered.,0,0
but they just they realize there's another person there.,0,1
so they bring her in.,0,1
and they place the slipper on her foot.,1,1
It fits perfectly and the prince is very happy and she's very happy and they're together.,1,1
and they live happily ever after.,1,1
A mature woman appears at the front door with two young girls.,1,1
And they have a cranky look on their face.,0,1
and then they show a third young girl playing with animals.,1,0
And uh using a broom or a mop or something cleaning.,1,0
And uh and then.,0,0
Let's see I guess they get invited to uh some kind of an affair.,1,1
and they the adults take off leave a little girl at home.,1,1
Um She sees a woman with a purple dress on.,1,1
and appears to be a fairy godmother uh.,1,1
I guess she cast a spell.,1,0
and shows her a picture of a fancy dress.,1,1
And uh she puts on this real nice dress.,1,1
and uh I guess she goes.,1,1
and shows her two other sisters.,1,0
I I think they laughed at her.,1,1
Uh they took off to the party.,1,1
She stays home.,1,1
and then uh the fairy godmother appears again gave her a nicer dress.,1,1
And then a pumpkin cart shows up uh.,1,1
She has a really nice white gown on.,1,1
She gets in the gown they go to the dance.,1,0
It appears she's dancing with this guy with a uniform on.,1,1
And then the clock strikes midnight she runs down like a ramp.,1,1
And disappears.,1,0
and gets home with one slipper.,1,1
And then later um the scene changes real quick.,1,1
and she ends up with the prince.,1,1
and he's hugging her in some way.,1,1
Let's move on to something a little different.,0,1
OK.,0,0
Cinderella was a wealthy young woman growing up with a father.,1,1
that loved her very much.,1,1
and her mother had died.,1,1
When the dad got remarried it drastically changed her life when uh the new mother the stepmother moved in with her two nasty daughters and they probably weren't very interested in the dad they just wanted his money.,1,1
And they started.,0,0
to use Cinderella as their servant.,1,1
Do you want me?,0,0
to continue with the rest of the story?,0,1
Yes please.,0,0
OK.,0,0
And then um she's out one day.,1,1
and she sees the handsome prince.,1,1
and sort of falls in love.,1,0
with him is fascinated with him.,1,1
and he gets a look at her.,1,1
and wants.,0,0
to see more of her.,1,0
but she is pretty much locked up in the house.,1,1
So he announces.,1,0
that he's gonna have a a ball.,1,1
And have all the women all the young women in the town.,1,1
and the country comes.,0,1
that he can see them all and they're all very excited.,1,0
and the mother-in-law stepmother gets them all uh take care of daughters who are very homely all dressed up.,1,1
and doing the best she can do for them and poor Cinderella who's locked up in the attic.,1,1
And uh can't get out.,1,1
to get a dress.,1,1
or go.,0,1
to the pool has all her little friends.,1,1
that she's made friends with the mice and the birds and all.,1,1
and they all make a very beautiful dress for her.,1,1
to wear and uh.,1,1
They make a coach.,1,1
to take her to the to the ball.,1,1
So she travels to the ball but what she knows is.,1,1
that she has to be home by the stroke of midnight.,1,1
because everything will change back to what it was.,1,1
The pet dogs will whoever they are mice will turn back into mice instead of the horses.,1,1
and the horseman will change back into whatever type of animal he was.,1,1
before the story started.,0,1
So she goes to the ball.,1,1
and he uh dances.,1,0
and he sees her.,1,1
and they start.,0,0
to get together and it's midnight.,1,1
so she has.,0,0
to run off.,1,1
One of her slippers falls off.,1,1
So now he has her crystal slipper.,1,1
So he's determined.,0,1
to find whoever in the coun in country.,1,1
Foot could fit into this.,1,1
So they have Cinderella locked up in.,1,1
while he's coming around to their house.,1,1
The ugly stepsisters try.,1,0
to cram their feet into it.,1,1
and I obviously can't get them in.,1,1
and she's she's locked up in the castle.,1,0
And I can't remember the right ending how.,0,0
How she ends up getting down.,1,0
It has.,0,0
to have something.,0,1
to do.,0,1
with the mice getting the key.,1,0
and letting her out I think.,1,0
And uh.,0,0
so she runs down they slipper fits.,1,1
and she ends up getting married.,1,1
and being happily married forever and ever.,1,1
Once upon a time.,0,1
There was a girl named Cinderella.,1,1
and she lived with her sisters and her mother.,1,0
And she had.,0,1
to do all the work.,1,1
And her sisters were getting ready for a ball.,1,1
and she was not invited.,1,1
