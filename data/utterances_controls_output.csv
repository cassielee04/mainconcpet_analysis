0,244-1,"So this is a long story, and this is the Disney version and not the Brothers Grimm version."
1,244-1,"So once upon a time, there was a very happy family with one little girl named Cinderella."
2,244-1,The mother had died.
3,244-1,"before the story starts,."
4,244-1,and the father wanted to.
5,244-1,Marry again.
6,244-1,that Cinderella would have a stepmother.
7,244-1,"So he did,."
8,244-1,"and he married this woman whose name I don't remember,."
9,244-1,but she also had two daughters named Anastasia and Rosella.
10,244-1,"And then the book did not tell us, but at this point it's important."
11,244-1,"that the father dies,."
12,244-1,cause he has to be out of the picture.
13,244-1,Didn't show me a picture of father dying.
14,244-1,"So , the mother really does not like Cinderella at all."
15,244-1,and starts to treat Cinderella if she were a servant.
16,244-1,And Cinderella has to do all the cleaning.
17,244-1,"and she wears dirty clothes,."
18,244-1,"and they're, they talk about the fact."
19,244-1,"that she has to clean out the fireplace, hence Cinder, Ella, and Anastasia and Driseella are mean to her."
20,244-1,And um that 's why the father has to be dead.
21,244-1,"So then we see the king, who's a rather blustering man, saying, my son has to marry the prince really needs a wife."
22,244-1,Would he please settle down.
23,244-1,and get a wife.
24,244-1,"We're going to have a ball where he can meet all the young women in the kingdom,."
25,244-1,and then he better choose a wife.
26,244-1,because really we need him to get married.
27,244-1,"So the invitation to the ball comes to the stepmother,."
28,244-1,and um it says all the young maidens must come to the ball.
29,244-1,"and Cinderella goes, God, this is great, I'm gonna be able to go."
30,244-1,"and the stepmother is like , yeah, mhm, sure."
31,244-1,So This probably wasn't in the book.
32,244-1,So actually the stepmother says.
33,244-1,"if you get all your work done, you can go, knowing full well."
34,244-1,that they were gonna put all sorts of work on her.
35,244-1,that would make it.
36,244-1,so she couldn't go.
37,244-1,"She also had nothing to wear, so the mice, including Gus,."
38,244-1,"if you've seen the movie Gus Gus Gus Gus Gus, the mice."
39,244-1,and the birds make a beautiful gown for her.
40,244-1,So she gets all her work done.
41,244-1,Anastasia.
42,244-1,"and Drsella are really making her get them ready, zip me up, tighten my corset, comb my hair, put my bow in my hair,."
43,244-1,"and they get all ready,."
44,244-1,and then Cinderella goes.
45,244-1,and puts her beautiful gown on that the birds.
46,244-1,and the mice have made for her.
47,244-1,"The family is loading into their carriage,."
48,244-1,and Cinderella comes out in this really very nice gown.
49,244-1,And Anastasia.
50,244-1,"and Driseella go nuts, rip the gown apart, make fun of Cinderella, make her."
51,244-1,"and go off without her,."
52,244-1,and she's left in tears.
53,244-1,But her fairy godmother appears.
54,244-1,"and said, Cinderella, you really, you're gonna be going to the ball."
55,244-1,"You don't want me to sing the song, do you?"
56,244-1,Saliadoola Mika boo la bibbidi babidi boo.
57,244-1,She sings a song with the magic.
58,244-1,Put them together.
59,244-1,"and what have you got bibbidi bobbidi boo, there's more, um,."
60,244-1,while she's doing.
61,244-1,"that , she sprinkles the fairy dust around the fairy godmother dust around."
62,244-1,and Cinderella gets a beautiful new gown.
63,244-1,"She turns a pumpkin into a carriage, turns the mice into footmen."
64,244-1,And she gives her some beautiful shoes?
65,244-1,"that , can you imagine are made of glass, comfortable?"
66,244-1,I think not.
67,244-1,"So , she goes off to the ball."
68,244-1,The carriage.
69,244-1,"and the footman deliver, oh, the fairy godmother says,."
70,244-1,"but you have to be done by midnight, you have to be home by midnight."
71,244-1,The magic wears off at midnight.
72,244-1,"So Cinderella goes to the ball, she walks in."
73,244-1,and the prince is smitten.
74,244-1,He's seen every other girl at the ball.
75,244-1,that are really preening.
76,244-1,"and preening for him, but this is the girl for him."
77,244-1,They dance a few dances.
78,244-1,and then they go out on the balcony.
79,244-1,"In the Disney version, they don't do a little smooching,."
80,244-1,but you never know.
81,244-1,"Suddenly, she hears the clock starting to ring 12."
82,244-1,"She goes, oh, it's 12 o'clock."
83,244-1,I've got to go.
84,244-1,"She runs away from him, she runs down the palace stairs."
85,244-1,"and one of her silver, one of her shoes falls off."
86,244-1,"She runs into the carriage, they take off, and at the end of midnight."
87,244-1,"The carriage turns back into a pumpkin, she's in her rags again."
88,244-1,"The footmen are mice again,."
89,244-1,"but oddly, the glass slippers have not turned back into shoes."
90,244-1,"Don't know why the magic on the slippers did not end at midnight,."
91,244-1,but the story wouldn't work without.
92,244-1,"So the prince really, really wants this girl."
93,244-1,"Nobody knows her name, and Anastasia."
94,244-1,and Rosella did not recognize her.
95,244-1,because she was all looking not.
96,244-1,like she had smudges on her face.
97,244-1,or wearing rags.
98,244-1,"So they start going, the prince."
99,244-1,and his Helpers start going door to door to find the girl.
100,244-1,that fits into the glass slipper.
101,244-1,When he arrives at their house.
102,244-1,Cinderella is not allowed to come up to the front where the prince is.
103,244-1,Anastasia tries it on.
104,244-1,Driseella tries it on.
105,244-1,They have big ugly feet.
106,244-1,It.
107,244-1,so doesn't fit.
108,244-1,"And in the Brothers Grimm version, they hack off their toes and their heels,."
109,244-1,and they still don't fit.
110,244-1,But Disney doesn't hack off toes and heels.
111,244-1,Somehow Cinderella manages to.
112,244-1,Get into the living room.
113,244-1,"that it fits, he loves her, they get married,."
114,244-1,and of course they live happily ever after.
115,46-1,"OK, Cinderella."
116,46-1,"Is uh Sort of a maid, I would say."
117,46-1,And she As In a house with 2.
118,46-1,I guess they're sisters.
119,46-1,They make her work and clean.
120,46-1,"and Really, uh, trigger real well."
121,46-1,So They should have made it.
122,46-1,The family gets invited to a ball.
123,46-1,And uh Cinderella's not invited.
124,46-1,She meets up with somebody that advise her to go to the ball.
125,46-1,And she Meets a fairy godmother who gives her a gun.
126,46-1,She goes to the ball.
127,46-1,And uh she meets her prince.
128,46-1,And she has on these glass slippers.
129,46-1,"Maybe, I don't know, glass or fancy lip."
130,46-1,"And uh she has to be home by 12 o'clock or 11 o'clock, something like that."
131,46-1,So she's leaving.
132,46-1,The prince don't want her to leave.
133,46-1,and she loses one of her slippers.
134,46-1,"And uh The next day He guys looking for you, he has a slipper."
135,46-1,Or somebody finds a slipper.
136,46-1,and takes it.
137,46-1,and it fits her foot.
138,46-1,So she ends up with a prince and a.
139,46-1,"Uh, carriage, it was a pump."
140,46-1,"Or something like that, that's the way I remember."
141,neural29-1,"Well, There once was a time that Cinderella and her two sisters and her evil mother."

151,neural29-1,She wasn't allowed to go to the to the ball.
152,neural29-1,"She was, I think, the ugly sister."

155,neural29-1,"Um, So the mother and the tube."
156,neural29-1,Sisters went to the ball.
157,neural29-1,Cinderella.

167,neural29-1,Cinderella with.
168,neural29-1,"No Beautiful dress, the pumpkin."

170,neural29-1,And the animals would go back to from horses to rodents.
171,neural29-1,"Um, the prince was very upset he couldn't find Cinderella."

182,neural29-1,Once He found Cinderella.
183,neural29-1,He made her his queen.
184,neural29-1,that 's about it.
185,221-1,"Um, Cinderella, uh, lived in a home with two stepsisters, um,."

257,08-1,and was reading her book up there.
258,08-1,"and Uh, commiserating with the little birds."

317,08-1,and I had to leave by midnight.
318,08-1,and go home.

330,08-1,That she was in such a hurry to be home.
331,08-1,before the clock struck 12.
332,08-1,She jumped into her coach.
333,08-1,and they Were whisked away by the horses.
334,08-1,The poor prince was left standing there.
335,08-1,He saw the glass slipper.
336,08-1,"and thought, oh my, maybe I can use this glass slipper to figure out who this lady was."

342,08-1,"And his men were going house to house in the kingdom, everyone trying on the glass slipper who looked."
343,08-1,like they might.
344,08-1,Possibly be the princess.
345,08-1,And no one had a foot delicate enough to fit into that glass slipper.
346,08-1,"Uh, he finally came to the home of Cinderella and her stepfamily."
347,08-1,"And her mother had her two ugly stepsisters try on the slipper,."
348,08-1,"but their feet wouldn't even go in the shoe, not at all."
349,08-1,And the prince knew they obviously weren't the lady he was looking for anyway.
350,08-1,"Uh,?"
351,08-1,"so he asked, is there anyone else in the house?"
352,08-1,"Oh, we have a maid upstairs,."
353,08-1,but she didn't go to the party.
354,08-1,and the prince said.
355,08-1,I want to meet her.
356,08-1,I'd.
357,08-1,like her to try on the slipper.
358,08-1,so The stepmom.
359,08-1,"and the step stepsisters couldn't refuse the prince's request,."
360,08-1,so they had Cinderella come down from her attic room.
361,08-1,And the prince was struck with her beauty even.
362,08-1,though she was plainly dressed.
363,08-1,"And the prince had her try on the shoe,."
364,08-1,"and she did,."
365,08-1,and it fit.
366,08-1,And she stood up.
367,08-1,"and The prince said, Aha, you are the lovely lady who was at the ball."
368,08-1,The shoe fits.
369,08-1,"Uh, I recognize you, uh, come back to the palace with me and uh."
370,08-1,They did.
371,08-1,and they got married.
372,08-1,and lived happily ever after.
373,276-1,OK.
374,276-1,"So, Cinderella."
375,276-1,She was living with her father.
376,276-1,"I think her mother must have been deceased,."
377,276-1,and her father remarried uh a woman.
378,276-1,"Uh, the father had a title, in fact,."
379,276-1,and the father remarried a woman who had two daughters.
380,276-1,"Uh, the father became disabled, killed, whatever,."
381,276-1,"and so this woman became her stepmother,."
382,276-1,and then she had these stepsisters.
383,276-1,Cinderella was treated very poorly by the stepmother.
384,276-1,"In fact, she was Uh, made to be a servant to these ugly, and these girls were ugly, uh, stepsisters,."
385,276-1,that she was treated poorly by the stepmother.
386,276-1,"Cinderella was able to, uh, have a glance,."
387,276-1,"and she could see the castle beyond where she was staying,."
388,276-1,and she could dream about what that would be like because her life was pretty sad at that point.
389,276-1,"Uh, in the castle, there was a Young man, he was the prince,."
390,276-1,and his parents wanted him to marry.
391,276-1,"And they decided to throw a big party, a ball, and for the purpose of him to meet someone there in the kingdom."
392,276-1,that he would marry.
393,276-1,"Cinderella, uh, stepsisters and the."
394,276-1,"and the What would you call this lady, the, the stepmother wanted her daughters to go to the ball with no interest in Cinderella going because she was just like a maid to them."
395,276-1,"Cinderella, uh, looks at a chest."
396,276-1,"that had belonged to her mother,."
397,276-1,"and she reads about things about her mother,."
398,276-1,and she wishes.
399,276-1,"that she could go,."
400,276-1,"as the story goes, Uh, her, she has a fairy godmother who comes into her life."
401,276-1,and changes some things that are at the house.
402,276-1,"And she's uh able to get dressed, be in a carriage, to go to the ball, uh have a nice time."
403,276-1,"She meets the prince,."
404,276-1,but the time came came.
405,276-1,"that she had to leave by a certain time, she left, left the shoe, she went back home."
406,276-1,"Uh, the prince goes looking for who this person was he danced with."
407,276-1,that he likes so much.
408,276-1,He takes the shoe with him.
409,276-1,"The shoe doesn't fit all these other women in the in the town,."
410,276-1,"but it, uh, when he gets a second chance."
411,276-1,"and sees Cinderella, the shoe fits her foot uh perfectly."
412,276-1,"He ends up, he marries Cinderella and her stepsisters and her stepmother."
413,276-1,"Uh, it are frowned upon by the royalty,."
414,276-1,and they get some terrible jobs to do.
415,276-1,and get put out.
416,101-1,There was a young girl living with her father.
417,101-1,Her father marries this woman who has two older daughters who are not as pretty as his little girl.
418,101-1,"Sadly, he dies."
419,101-1,And the stepmother is not very nice to this little girl.
420,101-1,"and makes her do all the cleaning in the house, doesn't let her get dressed up, doesn't let her go to parties."
421,101-1,Her sisters are very mean to her.
422,101-1,"One day the prince of the town, village, country, wherever it happens to be."
423,101-1,"that she's in, um, decides to have a ball because it's time."
424,101-1,for him to find a girlfriend or wife.
425,101-1,So they send invitations out throughout the land.
426,101-1,"and an invitation comes to Cinderella's house and her stepsisters are all happy about it and her stepmothers all happy about it,."
427,101-1,"and they say, well of course they can go,."
428,101-1,"but you, Cinderella cannot go."
429,101-1,"Um, so her sisters get dressed, they go off to the party."
430,101-1,"Cinderella is feeling very sad,."
431,101-1,"but she's, she has a lot of friends in the, um, animal world,."
432,101-1,"and they help make her, um."
433,101-1,They don't help her make a dress.
434,101-1,"She somehow is crying or whatever,."
435,101-1,and her fairy godmother comes.
436,101-1,and whips up this gorgeous dress for her.
437,101-1,and the little animals become the footman and the the pages and the people.
438,101-1,that will help her get ready for the ball.
439,101-1,"and we'll take her to the ball coachman, um,."
440,101-1,and the carriage is made out of a pumpkin.
441,101-1,"before she leaves her fairy godmother says you can have all this fun, but you must be back by the stroke of midnight that 's when all the magic goes."
442,101-1,and the mice become mice.
443,101-1,So Cinderella goes to the ball and she's absolutely stunning.
444,101-1,and her stepsisters notice.
445,101-1,"that there's this beautiful girl there,."
446,101-1,but um they don't recognize their shaggy looking little stepsister.
447,101-1,And the prince sees her and of course she's absolutely lovely.
448,101-1,"and the prince goes up and dances with her, but being The prince, he's not too bright,."
449,101-1,and he doesn't get her name and her address.
450,101-1,"So all of a sudden, the clock strikes 12."
451,101-1,Cinderella realizes.
452,101-1,that she's got to get home.
453,101-1,before everything changes back.
454,101-1,"She goes running down the steps of the castle,."
455,101-1,"as she's running, she loses one of her beautiful glass slippers, which."
456,101-1,"for some reason doesn't change back, even."
457,101-1,though all the rest of her clothes do.
458,101-1,"She get back, gets back to her place, her, her stepsisters come back."
459,101-1,They had a great time.
460,101-1,"Um, the next day the prince's footman, um,."
461,101-1,"and the prince go door to door to see who fits this tiny little glass slipper,."
462,101-1,and her sisters all tried on.
463,101-1,and of course they have big old feet.
464,101-1,and they don't fit.
465,101-1,"And um Cinderella says, well, wait, let me try it on,."
466,101-1,and she comes down.
467,101-1,"and it fits perfectly,."
468,101-1,and her sisters are all pissed off.
469,101-1,"and her stepmothers all pissed off, um, but the prince, although he's dumb, he's very sweet,."
470,101-1,"and he says, oh, this is perfect, the shoe fits, you're pretty, let's get married."
471,101-1,and we will live happily ever after.
472,101-1,that is the Disney version.
473,233-1,apparently married a second wife.
474,233-1,and who had 3 daughters.
475,233-1,that she doted on.
476,233-1,And Cinderella was left to do all the chores.
477,233-1,while the dollars were living in luxury.
478,233-1,But then there was an announcement from the palace.
479,233-1,"that there was going to be a ball, and the sisters are so excited."
480,233-1,about getting new gowns.
481,233-1,and getting all dressed up to go to the ball.
482,233-1,But they won't let Cinderella go.
483,233-1,because she doesn't have the clothes to wear.
484,233-1,So the the stepsisters get all dressed.
485,233-1,and they go off to the ball leaving Cinderella at home.
486,233-1,"And ,."
487,233-1,"but , Cinderella's fairy godmother comes with her little mice."
488,233-1,And gets her all dressed up in a nice ball gown.
489,233-1,A special carriage.
490,233-1,"And the horsemen are the horses, I think the mice become the horsemen horses in this."
491,233-1,"But anyway, so she goes off to the ball."
492,233-1,"In her beautiful white dress, she dances with the prince."
493,233-1,"He falls madly in love with her,."
494,233-1,"but she has to be out of there by midnight, so on the way down the steps leaving, she loses her glass slipper."
495,233-1,And the prince takes the glass slipper.
496,233-1,and tries it to fit it on the women in the town where they live in his kingdom.
497,233-1,"And all those women, they want him to, you know, find them."
498,233-1,and marry them.
499,233-1,and make them a princess.
500,233-1,Then he comes to Cinderella and the last you.
501,39-1,"Well, this is the Walt Disney Cinderella story."
502,39-1,"um,."
503,39-1,so all the characters are based on the story.
504,39-1,that Walt Disney has created.
505,39-1,Cinderella was a girl living with her father in a nice mansion.
506,39-1,"Um, her father, I don't know what happened to her mother, but it was just her father who married another woman who became her stepmother, who had two daughters who became Cinderella's stepsisters."
507,39-1,"Well, the father passed away,."
508,39-1,and the stepmother took over rule of the castle and everything else.
509,39-1,that they lived in.
510,39-1,"because her the stepmother valued the her own daughters over Cinderella, Cinderella became more or less a slave to the stepmother and the stepsister's wishes, which is why her name became Cinderella,."
511,39-1,because she toiled.
512,39-1,"and stayed in the kitchen near the cinders, which got all over her clothes most of the time when she was working."
513,39-1,"One day, the prince, um, was in the castle,."
514,39-1,"and his father, the king, decided it was time for the prince to marry."
515,39-1,So the only way he could find a suitable wife.
516,39-1,for Cinderella was decided to throw a big ball.
517,39-1,and invite every young maiden in the whole area to come.
518,39-1,"and meet the prince,."
519,39-1,and the prince would select a suitable prospective wife.
520,39-1,So they sent out letters far and wide for every young maiden.
521,39-1,The stepmother was thrilled with this.
522,39-1,because she was sending her own two daughters.
523,39-1,and was dressing them in the finest dresses she could find.
524,39-1,"for them, sparing no expense."
525,39-1,"Cinderella, however, begged to go to the ball,."
526,39-1,but the stepmother said no.
527,39-1,"because Cinderella did not have a dress,."
528,39-1,and she would not provide a dress for Cinderella.
529,39-1,"So , Cinderella went into an old trunk."
530,39-1,and found a very pretty pink dress.
531,39-1,"that was owned by her mother,."
532,39-1,but it didn't fit quite right.
533,39-1,"So Cinderella started to alter the dress with the help of two of the Couple of the mice from the kitchen, um, Zach,."
534,39-1,"and I'm trying to remember the other names,."
535,39-1,"cause I thought I knew them, were helping her to do the dress,."
536,39-1,"and they were singing, Let's make a dress for Cinderella."
537,39-1,so the dress looked beautiful.
538,39-1,"However, when it came time to go to the ball, the stepsisters came down."
539,39-1,and were dressed very beautifully.
540,39-1,And Cinderella came down in her dress.
541,39-1,"Well, the stepmother was enraged that Cinderella was able to find a dress."
542,39-1,So between the stepmother.
543,39-1,"and the stepsisters, they destroyed the dress."
544,39-1,and poor Cinderella could not go to the ball.
545,39-1,"So ,."
546,39-1,as she sat crying.
547,39-1,"because she couldn't go to the ball, lo."
548,39-1,"and behold, a wonderful woman appeared, known as her fairy godmother,."
549,39-1,"and said, Not to worry, we will get you to the ball."
550,39-1,"And Bippity boppity boo,."
551,39-1,"if you want, I'll sing the whole song,."
552,39-1,but I won't do that right now.
553,39-1,"Um,."
554,39-1,"so she provided a very beautiful dress for Cinderella, Blue, um, with sparkles, um."
555,39-1,And had Cinderella's hair all done up.
556,39-1,"Well,?"
557,39-1,"but Cinderella could go to the ball dressed like this with beautiful glass slippers,?"
558,39-1,but how could she get there?
559,39-1,"So , the fairy godmother turned the mice into horse horses to draw a carriage."
560,39-1,"To make a carriage, she, um, used a pumpkin, and the, um, footman for the carriage was the dog."
561,39-1,"So , Cinderella goes off to the ball,."
562,39-1,"but the fairy godmother said, but you must be home by the stroke of midnight,."
563,39-1,because all of this will disappear.
564,39-1,"Well, when Cinderella shows up at the ball."
565,39-1,All heads turn her way.
566,39-1,"because she is not only the most beautifully dressed, but she is the most beautiful girl at the ball."
567,39-1,While the stepmother.
568,39-1,"Keeps looking at things, she looks familiar, she looks familiar,."
569,39-1,but she couldn't decide.
570,39-1,"Well, the prince walked past every one of all the other girls."
571,39-1,and danced only with Cinderella that night.
572,39-1,Cinderella was having a very good time.
573,39-1,"However, the clock started to strike midnight,."
574,39-1,and Cinder Cinderella realized.
575,39-1,"that she had to be home,."
576,39-1,"so she ran out very quickly,."
577,39-1,"and running down the steps, she lost one of her glass slippers."
578,39-1,and just about got home.
579,39-1,"Well, the poor prince was so upset."
580,39-1,that he did not know who this girl was.
581,39-1,"or could not find her, did not have a name, that the next day, the prince."
582,39-1,and his entourage went out to the countryside.
583,39-1,and took the one glass slipper.
584,39-1,and tried to fit it on every young maiden in the area.
585,39-1,"So , knowing."
586,39-1,"that this was coming to happen, the stepmother decided to lock Cinderella into the castle, into the house,."
587,39-1,so she could not meet the prince.
588,39-1,"Well, just."
589,39-1,as the prince was trying on the slipper.
590,39-1,"for the two stepsisters, one, both of whom had very large feet, and not the tiny foot."
591,39-1,"that would fit into this glass slipper, Cinderella and the mice were able to free her from the area where she was locked."
592,39-1,"And went downstairs, just?"
593,39-1,"as Cinderella came running out, when the prince said, Aren't there any other young maidens in your house?"
594,39-1,"And the stepmother said, No."
595,39-1,Cinderella came running out.
596,39-1,"and said, Yes, I'm here, I'm here."
597,39-1,"Well, just."
598,39-1,"as she was running, the stepmother tripped her."
599,39-1,And the slipper was the slipper.
600,39-1,that the prince was holding to walk to her was broken.
601,39-1,"Brokenhearted, the prince said, Well, I'll never know who the girl is."
602,39-1,"And Cinderella said, Well, that 's all right,."
603,39-1,because I have the other slipper here.
604,39-1,So he tried the slipper onto Cinderella.
605,39-1,"It fit beautifully,."
606,39-1,"and just then, of course, the fairy godmother came by, changed Cinderella into a beautiful princess again,."
607,39-1,and off she went with the prince to be married.
608,39-1,and live happily ever after.
609,39-1,"The stepmother and the stepsisters, however, were not so happy about this, neither was Cinderella."
610,39-1,"So Cinderella made them become servants into the prince's castle, that 's the end of the story."
611,39-1,Cinderella was happy with the prince.
612,39-1,"They lived happily ever after, and the stepmother."
613,39-1,and stepsister got what they deserved.
614,04-1,"Her name, uh, I'm not even sure her name was Cinderella,."
615,04-1,"but there was a young girl, maybe her name was even Ella,."
616,04-1,and later on she gets called Cinderella.
617,04-1,"Um, anyway, she ends up having a stepmother come on the scene who has two daughters, and she's very nice to her two daughters, but she's mean to Cinderella."
618,04-1,"Uh, the two daughters, uh, are, are pampered."
619,04-1,and treated very well.
620,04-1,"Cinderella has to do a lot of the housework and the grunt work and ,."
621,04-1,and clean the fireplace.
622,04-1,and do all kinds of things like.
623,04-1,"that Uh, then one day they are invited to a ball, a royal ball, and , um, the daughters."
624,04-1,"and the stepmother get all dressed up and all fancy,."
625,04-1,but Cinderella is told.
626,04-1,that she may not go.
627,04-1,"She has, she has to do chores at home instead."
628,04-1,"while the stepmother and the daughters, her daughters are gone, uh, Cinderella finds out."
629,04-1,"that she has a fairy godmother,."
630,04-1,"and the fairy godmother, uh, gets her all dressed."
631,04-1,"and has these little helpers, little, they look like little mice helpers,."
632,04-1,"and she, um, makes a beautiful dress for Cinderella,."
633,04-1,and Cinderella goes.
634,04-1,"and they, they take a pumpkin."
635,04-1,and the pumpkin becomes a beautiful um coach.
636,04-1,"And the um little critters become horses,."
637,04-1,"and they take her to the ball,."
638,04-1,"and she dances with the the the handsome prince,."
639,04-1,and then she knows she has to be back by midnight.
640,04-1,or the the coach will turn into a pumpkin again.
641,04-1,"So she quickly leaves the the ball at midnight,."
642,04-1,"as she leaves, uh one of her glass slippers comes off."
643,04-1,"and the prince wants to find her, and his clue is the glass slipper."
644,04-1,So he goes.
645,04-1,Throughout the kingdom.
646,04-1,"and to find the girl who fits the glass slipper,."
647,04-1,"and he, the, the stepdaughters tried, they're hoping."
648,04-1,that they'll fit into the slipper.
649,04-1,"because they want to marry the handsome prince, but ,."
650,04-1,"and they, they try to pretend."
651,04-1,"that Cinderella really doesn't need to try it on,."
652,04-1,"but she does,."
653,04-1,"and it fits her, and she."
654,04-1,and the prince marry.
655,04-1,and live happily ever after.
656,wright01a,Is this a story about Cinderella.
657,wright01a,Who was kind um.
658,wright01a,And girl.
659,wright01a,And she had a stepmother and two stepsisters.
660,wright01a,"That she was in the His family and everything,."
661,wright01a,but the stepmother treated the stepsisters very good.
662,wright01a,and treated her very bad.
663,wright01a,"I mean, she had to clean everything."
664,wright01a,"She had, All the work."
665,wright01a,"and she was just treated like, Oh, good."
666,wright01a,"so anyway, that 's the way it went all the time."
667,wright01a,It was continual.
668,wright01a,"Nothing she could do about it,."
669,wright01a,"but she enjoyed the, the animals."
670,wright01a,"You know, the dog and the cat."
671,wright01a,Mouse and She was just a very nice young lady.
672,wright01a,She's supposed.
673,wright01a,"And then, um, There was a ball coming up."
674,wright01a,"that they were all invited to, the whole family."
675,wright01a,"And um,."
676,wright01a,But the stepmother Wouldn't let her go.
677,wright01a,She said she had to stay home.
678,wright01a,and clean the fireplace.
679,wright01a,Do chores.
680,wright01a,because she could not go.
681,wright01a,"So , why the step, the stepmother."
682,wright01a,and the two stepsisters were getting all ready to go.
683,wright01a,and got all new dresses and jewelry.
684,wright01a,"and , You know, we're getting all ready to go to it."
685,wright01a,She got really sad.
686,wright01a,"She was very sad, very, very sad."
687,wright01a,"So , the stepmom."
688,wright01a,and the two stepsisters left.
689,wright01a,"To go to the ball, and this was a prince's ball."
690,wright01a,It was actually a king's ball.
691,wright01a,"And , uh,."
692,wright01a,So she went outside.
693,wright01a,and I believe she's probably.
694,wright01a,Like a fairy godmother came along.
695,wright01a,and was sitting out in the garden.
696,wright01a,I was talking to her?
697,wright01a,"and says, Do you wanna go?"

838,neural15-1,that he tried it on the two ugly stepsisters.
839,neural15-1,and didn't fit.

901,36-1,"Bitter and evil all the way to the end,."
902,36-1,but now they're trying their best to get into her good graces.
903,neural14-1,"So once upon a time, There was a a very wicked lady."
904,neural14-1,"Who had 3 daughters, and one day, Her husband."
905,neural14-1,"I think, um, adopted."
906,neural14-1,or brought in a new child into the household.
907,neural14-1,And the sisters.
908,neural14-1,"or the sister, the, the three sisters did not like this new child,."
909,neural14-1,and they commanded her to do all kinds of menial work and tasks.
910,neural14-1,and do their laundry.
911,neural14-1,"and sweep the floors,."
912,neural14-1,"but she consoled herself and her friendship with animals, and be it horses or dogs, or even mice."
913,neural14-1,"Um, she was very friendly to animals, so what she didn't, what love she didn't get from her sisters."
914,neural14-1,"or the sisters in the household, she got from the little creatures."
915,neural14-1,that surrounded her every day when she was going about her tasks.
916,neural14-1,"Then one day, a notice came."
917,neural14-1,"that the governor of the land was going to hold, hold."
918,neural14-1,"Uh, a ball And ,."
919,neural14-1,and the household was invited to the ball.
920,neural14-1,So Cinderella thought.
921,neural14-1,that included her.
922,neural14-1,"because the whole household was invited,."
923,neural14-1,but her sisters told her differently.
924,neural14-1,"And furthermore, they told her."
925,neural14-1,"that she was not, not only not invited,."
926,neural14-1,but she was not appropriately dressed.
927,neural14-1,"or could not, did not have a dress."
928,neural14-1,that would suit the occasion.
929,neural14-1,"So they left for the ball and Cinderella was very, very sad."
930,neural14-1,"But here comes the fairy, the godmother fairy."
931,neural14-1,"And says, what would you like to do, my child?"
932,neural14-1,"And she says, I would like to go to the ball."
933,neural14-1,"So,."
934,neural14-1,"but I don't have a dress,."
935,neural14-1,"and the fairy said, no problem, we're going to whip up the dress with my magic wand,."
936,neural14-1,and Cinderella found herself in this magnificent dress and a very nice pair of shoes.
937,neural14-1,"Not only that , but also a carriage."
938,neural14-1,that was going to take her to the ball.
939,neural14-1,So she goes to the ball.
940,neural14-1,"and impresses everybody, including the, the prince."
941,neural14-1,"The, the king's son Um, who falls desperately in love with her,."
942,neural14-1,"but the fairy had said, you must be back by midnight."
943,neural14-1,or you're gonna turn into a pumpkin.
944,neural14-1,So Cinderella hurries back.
945,neural14-1,"And makes it back before midnight,."
946,neural14-1,but leaves behind a shoe.
947,neural14-1,So the prince knew that the owner of the shoe was the woman?
948,neural14-1,"that he wanted to marry, but where was she?"
949,neural14-1,She was nowhere to be seeing.
950,neural14-1,"So he started a campaign to find the owner of the shoe,."
951,neural14-1,and they had to find the person.
952,neural14-1,Whom the shoe fit perfectly.
953,neural14-1,"And they went to the sisters,."
954,neural14-1,"and even the mother tried her luck,."
955,neural14-1,"but the shoe would not fit,."
956,neural14-1,and so no candidate was found to marry the prince.
957,neural14-1,until one of the animals told the surveyor.
958,neural14-1,that she should try it on Cinderella.
959,neural14-1,And when the surveyor did.
960,neural14-1,"that , the shoe fit Cinderella perfectly."
961,neural14-1,"So the prince had found the woman he wanted to marry from the ball,."
962,neural14-1,and they lived happily ever after.
963,92-1,OK.
964,92-1,All right.
965,92-1,Cinderella.
966,92-1,The stepmother and the stepsisters were very cruel to her.
967,92-1,"What they did is they made her do all the cleaning, um, taking care of all the animals, uh."
968,92-1,"Not attractive, which she was very beautiful,."
969,92-1,and um they lived close to a castle.
970,92-1,"and uh the uh prince uh they actually the king wanted his son, the prince, wanted to marry, so he."
971,92-1,"or he um um invited all the ladies, all the young ladies of the land."
972,92-1,"To come for um a dance and a special event, um, dressed in their best dresses,."
973,92-1,so the stepmother actually um told Cinderella.
974,92-1,that she could not attend.
975,92-1,The stepmother got the invitation.
976,92-1,and she was delighted.
977,92-1,"cause she wanted to marry off her one of at least one of her daughters, and the daughters were very excited."
978,92-1,and they got very groomed.
979,92-1,and dressed.
980,92-1,"and hair done and beautiful dresses, um, and Cinderella was very sad."
981,92-1,"cause the stepmother said she could not attend uh this, this, um."
982,92-1,Beautiful gala and um.
983,92-1,"so she had to clean the floor, take care of the animals,."
984,92-1,and then the um magical uh mouse mouse mice came by.
985,92-1,and said.
986,92-1,"that Um, there's a fairy godmother."
987,92-1,"that was gonna come visit her,."
988,92-1,"and with the this part, the, the, the pictures kind of went through,."
989,92-1,"but knowing the story, the fairy godmother with her magical wand, um, beauty uh um."
990,92-1,Had a Cinderella put in a gorgeous dress.
991,92-1,and had her hair done.
992,92-1,"and um gave her glass slippers to put on,."
993,92-1,"and then with the animals she had um she snapped her one, it was a beautiful chariot."

995,92-1,that um pulled the the um the beautiful pumpkin uh chariot and uh.
996,92-1,"Anyway, she went to the ball."
997,92-1,and the uh prince with among all the ladies there was was.
998,92-1,so attracted by Cinderella.
999,92-1,He was just giggle eyed over.
1000,92-1,"and uh danced with her, and the stepmother."
1001,92-1,"and the stepsisters were, you know, snarled."
1002,92-1,"and watched as a Cinderella, not knowing it was Cinderella."
1003,92-1,That was a couple minutes to 12.
1004,92-1,and she ran down the stairs.
1005,92-1,So we went all through the town trying on the glass slip.
1006,92-1,"Did not fit, didn't fit."
1007,92-1,"So then he saw Cinderella, which the grand the stepmother did not want him to meet her,."
1008,92-1,"but she, he insisted,."

1014,92-1,Happily ever after.
1015,wright10a,OK.

1022,wright10a,Didn't like Cinderella because she was so beautiful.
1023,wright10a,And they were mean to Cinderella.

1040,wright10a,"and the stepmother gave her a particularly long list of very long, difficult, dirty jobs, knowing that Cinderella would never be able to finish them."

1047,wright10a,The animals loved her.
1048,wright10a,"The animals helped her do her chores,."
1049,wright10a,and they all worked very hard.
1050,wright10a,and they put together a dress for her.
1051,wright10a,because she had nothing to wear to the ball.
1052,wright10a,"When it was time to go to the ball, she went downstairs."
1053,wright10a,And when the sisters.
1054,wright10a,and the Stepmother saw how beautiful she looked in the beautiful dress.
1055,wright10a,"They just went crazy with rage,."
1056,wright10a,and they tore the dress off of her and the pins out of her hair.
1057,wright10a,They pushed her down.
1058,wright10a,And told her.
1059,wright10a,that she didn't deserve to come to the ball.
1060,wright10a,Crying.
1061,wright10a,She went back to her room where her animal friends comforted her.
1062,wright10a,Then the fairy godmother appeared.
1063,wright10a,And took pity on Cinderella.
1064,wright10a,"With a wave of her wand, the fairy godmother."
1065,wright10a,Produced a dress for Cinderella that was more gorgeous than any dress anybody had ever seen.
1066,wright10a,Cinderella looked beautiful.
1067,wright10a,The stepmother.
1068,wright10a,or the fairy godmother said.
1069,wright10a,"that Cinderella was to go to the ball,."
1070,wright10a,but she had to be back home by midnight.
1071,wright10a,Because at midnight.
1072,wright10a,Her clothes and her carriage.
1073,wright10a,and everything were going to disappear.
1074,wright10a,and go back to normal.
1075,wright10a,So she took some mice.
1076,wright10a,and with a wave of her wand she turned them into horses.
1077,wright10a,"Turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage,."
1078,wright10a,and Cinderella climbed in her beautiful gown.
1079,wright10a,and went to the ball.
1080,wright10a,Everyone was amazed.
1081,wright10a,"and stunned at this beautiful woman who entered the ballroom,."
1082,wright10a,and the prince fell.
1083,wright10a,in love immediately.
1084,wright10a,They danced all night.
1085,wright10a,She was having such a good time.
1086,wright10a,"Cinderella was, she didn't realize how late it was."
1087,wright10a,And As the clock.
1088,wright10a,Struck the first.
1089,wright10a,"Bell for 12 o'clock, she looked up."
1090,wright10a,and realized how late it was.
1091,wright10a,and what was going to happen.
1092,wright10a,"With a gasp, she ran out of the ballroom."
1093,wright10a,Leaving the prince.
1094,wright10a,"Shocked, not knowing what was going on, she ran out of the ballroom and down the stairs."
1095,wright10a,"She had to get out of there before the last bong, before the 12th bong bell."
1096,wright10a,On the way down the steps she tripped.
1097,wright10a,and lost a slipper.
1098,wright10a,Beautiful little glass slipper.
1099,wright10a,She made it home And all the beautiful dresses.
1100,wright10a,and Pumpkin coach.
1101,wright10a,and horses turned back into what they had been.
1102,wright10a,before the fairy godmother visited.
1103,wright10a,"So she had made it home safely without anybody figuring out who she was,."
1104,wright10a,"and she went, she went to her room."
1105,wright10a,and went to sleep dreaming about the prince.
1106,wright10a,The prince wasn't happy.
1107,wright10a,"because he didn't know who she was, where she lived,."
1108,wright10a,and he didn't know when he was going to see her again.
1109,wright10a,So He took the glass slipper.
1110,wright10a,"and had his, his."
1111,wright10a,Servant.
1112,wright10a,Go to every house in the city.
1113,wright10a,"and all the girls had to try on the slipper,."
1114,wright10a,and he knew that whoever the slipper fit was going to be the girl whom he had fallen.
1115,wright10a,in love with at the dance or at the ball.
1116,wright10a,"The 2 girls, the 2 stepsisters, tried to fit their feet into the slipper, but their feet were too big."
1117,wright10a,"And the servant said, isn't there anyone else?"
1118,wright10a,I've searched all the houses.
1119,wright10a,There's gotta be somebody else.
1120,wright10a,and just then Cinderella appeared.
1121,wright10a,In her work dress.
1122,wright10a,"And he says, ah, here's another girl."
1123,wright10a,She needs to try on the slipper too.
1124,wright10a,So Cinderella placed her foot into the slipper.
1125,wright10a,and it slid in very easily.
1126,wright10a,And she smiled.
1127,wright10a,and the servant smiled.
1128,wright10a,"and said, Ah, at last I found you,."
1129,wright10a,and he brought Cinderella back to the castle.
1130,wright10a,while the sisters stared after her.
1131,wright10a,With anger in their eyes.
1132,wright10a,The prince was very happy.
1133,wright10a,That his servant had found Cinderella.
1134,wright10a,They got married.
1135,wright10a,Cinderella invited her stepmother and stepsisters to come and live in the castle with them.
1136,wright10a,And she was kind to them.
1137,wright10a,"And They all lived and they were sorry for how mean they had been to her,."
1138,wright10a,and they all lived happily ever after.
1139,wright10a,Thanks.
1140,wright10a,Is that the last one?
1141,wright10a,"Yes, you're done."
1142,neural4-1,"As I remember the story, Cinderella came to live with the, the, the mean old lady and her two daughters,."
1143,neural4-1,"and um she, they, she became the housemaid,."
1144,neural4-1,"if you will,."
1145,neural4-1,"because they, for whatever reason, they didn't want her around."
1146,neural4-1,And um she cleaned the house.
1147,neural4-1,"and did all the stuff,."
1148,neural4-1,and one day found out about a ball.
1149,neural4-1,"that was happening,."
1150,neural4-1,and wished.
1151,neural4-1,"that she could go, but um she wasn't terribly Welcome there."
1152,neural4-1,"So she, um, I don't even remember the story."
1153,neural4-1,She finally did get to go.
1154,neural4-1,"Her fairy godmother came by, tapped her on the head, she turned her into a little princess,."
1155,neural4-1,"and she went to the, to the ball, met the, the prince, um, realized."
1156,neural4-1,"that she was going to turn back at midnight, so she ran out, dropped her slipper, uh, her was in the silver slipper,."
1157,neural4-1,"but she dropped her slipper,."
1158,neural4-1,"and the prince was so enamored with her, he sent people out to find her, they found her."
1159,neural4-1,He tried on the shoe.
1160,neural4-1,"First, the, the bad sisters wanted the shoe, none of them fit."
1161,neural4-1,"She tried it on, it fit."
1162,neural4-1,He fell in love.
1163,neural4-1,and they lived happily ever after.
1164,neural4-1,That 's the short version.
1165,98-1,OK.
1166,98-1,"So, um, a man had a daughter, Cinderella,."
1167,98-1,and he married a woman with two daughters.
1168,98-1,"Um, as soon as the stepmother."
1169,98-1,"and the stepsisters met Cinderella, they They were off to a bad start."
1170,98-1,It was a bad relationship from the beginning.
1171,98-1,"The father dies,."
1172,98-1,and the stepmother treats Cinderella.
1173,98-1,and the stepsisters treat Cinderella if she is a servant in her house.
1174,98-1,that she grew up in.
1175,98-1,"Um, she does all kinds of, you know, menial labor,."
1176,98-1,"and she befriends in the Disney version, she befriends animals, they become her companions."
1177,98-1,"Um,."
1178,98-1,"As time goes by, she grows up, grows older,."
1179,98-1,and the prince in the nearby palace is getting ready to be married.
1180,98-1,The king sends out a Decree telling all the eligible young women to come to a ball at the palace.
1181,98-1,And the stepsisters and stepmother are very excited for the stepsisters to go to the ball.
1182,98-1,"Um, Cinderella, they don't even tell her about it,."
1183,98-1,"if they do, they say she can't go."
1184,98-1,But she finds a dress.
1185,98-1,and she puts it on.
1186,98-1,"Um, they're very angry."
1187,98-1,that she would even think.

1193,98-1,"So, they got all ready, they were excited."
1194,98-1,They went.
1195,98-1,"Cinderella had to stay home,."
1196,98-1,"but her fairy godmother showed up,."
1197,98-1,"and um in the Disney version, she turns various animals into a coach and a coachman and um A pumpkin into a coach, I guess, and the animals and coachmen and people."
1198,98-1,"that help her get there,."
1199,98-1,"and she Magically, um, gives her a beautiful new dress."
1200,98-1,The only rule is.
1201,98-1,"that she can go to the ball,."
1202,98-1,but she has to be home by midnight.
1203,98-1,So she goes to the ball and um the stepsisters are there and are very excited.
1204,98-1,"Um,."
1205,98-1,"that the prince might notice them,."
1206,98-1,"but he only has eyes for Cinderella,."
1207,98-1,and he dances with her.
1208,98-1,"Um,."
1209,98-1,"as it comes close to midnight, she realizes."
1210,98-1,"that she has to leave,."
1211,98-1,or she will lose her fancy dress.
1212,98-1,and her coachman will turn back into mice and the coach into a pumpkin.
1213,98-1,"So she runs out, runs down the stairs,."
1214,98-1,and loses one of her glass slippers.
1215,98-1,"Um,."
1216,98-1,"and the prince runs after her, but all he can find is her glass slipper."

1221,98-1,"if it fits, then He will know that it's his true love from the fall."
1222,98-1,So they get to Cinderella's house.
1223,98-1,and the stepsisters try on the shoe.
1224,98-1,"and it doesn't fit,."
1225,98-1,but he sees Cinderella.

1235,capilouto04a,"Uh,."
1236,capilouto04a,"As they, are living together, uh."

1238,capilouto04a,that the king is going to give a ball.
1239,capilouto04a,"Uh, for the prince."
1240,capilouto04a,And Cinderella looks through a trunk.
1241,capilouto04a,Finding some clothing.
1242,capilouto04a,"But She's not allowed to go to the ball, so the other two ugly stepdaughters."
1243,capilouto04a,"Uh, dress up in the pretty clothes."
1244,capilouto04a,"that they find,."
1245,capilouto04a,and Cinderella needs to go out to the.
1246,capilouto04a,Stable to take care of the animals.
1247,capilouto04a,and of course do all the other work around the house.
1248,capilouto04a,And Cinderella is very disappointed.
1249,capilouto04a,"because she won't be allowed to go to the ball,."
1250,capilouto04a,"but Um, The other stepdaughters do, while they are gone."
1251,capilouto04a,The fairy godmother.
1252,capilouto04a,and all the mice come in to talk to Cinderella.
1253,capilouto04a,"and dress her in the fairy godmother, of course, dresses her in finery."
1254,capilouto04a,and changes uh the pumpkin into a fancy coach.
1255,capilouto04a,"And Cinderella goes to the ball and dances with the prince,."
1256,capilouto04a,"but when the clock strikes 12, Cinderella has to rush out and down the palace steps to go away from the ball."
1257,capilouto04a,And the Men who work for the king then take the glass slipper.
1258,capilouto04a,"that Cinderella had lost on her flight out of the palace to see who it will fit,."
1259,capilouto04a,and when they come to Cinderella's house.
1260,capilouto04a,"It fits Cinderella,."
1261,capilouto04a,and therefore Cinderella is happily married to the prince.
1262,25-1,There was a Home With a wicked stepmother and two spoiled brat daughters.
1263,25-1,And for reasons.
1264,25-1,"that were never made clear, Uh, Cinderella came to live with him by for order."
1265,25-1,Because she would not have come voluntarily.
1266,25-1,They did not treat her well.
1267,25-1,"Um,."
1268,25-1,But she did the best she could.
1269,25-1,Now the place where they lived was having a grand party.
1270,25-1,Given by Somebody who lives in a better neighborhood and counts.
1271,25-1,And he went.
1272,25-1,and he created the guest list.
1273,25-1,"That included these two spoiled brat daughters,."
1274,25-1,but Cinderella could come too.
1275,25-1,"if she wanted, even though she wasn't on the formal guest list."
1276,25-1,"And the wicked, yeah, you you have a dress."
1277,25-1,The party wasn't intended for you.
1278,25-1,The party was intended for people who are better than you.
1279,25-1,But she managed to go.
1280,25-1,or to get herself on the B list.
1281,25-1,And found a dress.
1282,25-1,"And Uh, found her way here."
1283,25-1,"Now, the, the CEO Had a had a son."
1284,25-1,"Now, now this son was in good shape."
1285,25-1,"He, he wasn't like one of these spoiled sons."
1286,25-1,He was a mensch.
1287,25-1,And it was his job to make as the cruise director for his father to make sure everybody had a good time at that party.
1288,25-1,Yeah.
1289,25-1,"Um, he decided to hang out in the corner."
1290,25-1,"and watch girls, even though he was a mensch."
1291,25-1,And the one.
1292,25-1,that caught his eye was Cinderella.
1293,25-1,Now Cinderella really wasn't on the invite.
1294,25-1,"She got Uh, a conditional invite."
1295,25-1,That she had to leave by midnight.
1296,25-1,Where she would turn into a pumpkin.
1297,25-1,"So Uh, she was having a good time and she's not a clock watcher."
1298,25-1,"She's just having a good time,."
1299,25-1,and it gets awfully close to midnight.
1300,25-1,And the uh little reminder on her watch went off I better get out of here.
1301,25-1,So she runs out.
1302,25-1,and she has no transportation pole.
1303,25-1,But kind of hitches a ride on this coast.
1304,25-1,that looks like a pumpkin.
1305,25-1,"And in on her way out, she's in a hurry."
1306,25-1,"She, um, Loss her glass slipper."
1307,25-1,"Uh, anyway, she makes it home."
1308,25-1,"And now she's back where she started,."
1309,25-1,but she had a good time.
1310,25-1,"Meanwhile, that Uh, Um, CEO to be."
1311,25-1,"So I need to go find that girl, better than any of the the other girls."
1312,25-1,How am I gonna find that girl?
1313,25-1,"And he, he Retrieves that glass slipper."
1314,25-1,"And says, well, I am going to get into my jalopy,."
1315,25-1,and I am going to ride around every single house.
1316,25-1,And see who's Foot fits into that slipper.
1317,25-1,that is exactly what he did.
1318,25-1,after a lot of this doesn't fit.
1319,25-1,"He came across, he went to the house of the wicked stepmother."
1320,25-1,Who thought.
1321,25-1,that uh this this was custom made for her daughter.
1322,25-1,"Or one of her daughters,."
1323,25-1,but it wasn't.
1324,25-1,"And Cinderella said, let me try."
1325,25-1,"No, you can't try."
1326,25-1,"And the, the Um, Uh, I, I guess Prince."
1327,25-1,"or whatever, uh, said, now we try everybody, we are an all inclusive community."
1328,25-1,And he found out that it really was Cinderella's slipper.
1329,25-1,"And therefore, Cinderella must have been The lady."
1330,25-1,that he had his eyes on.
1331,25-1,"At, at the party."
1332,25-1,And he didn't stop at the party.
1333,25-1,"He just wanted her, so he."
1334,25-1,You come in with me?
1335,25-1,"And she goes, Better."
1336,25-1,than staying here.
1337,25-1,And they went into his car.

1339,25-1,And they lived.
1340,25-1,"OK, doesn't doesn't quite say for how long, but indefinitely."
1341,203-1,"Well, there once was a, a young woman named uh Cinderella, um who had an evil stepmother who did not like her,."
1342,203-1,"and she also had sisters who did not like her,."
1343,203-1,and they ridiculed her.
1344,203-1,and made her feel bad about herself.
1345,203-1,"Um, She encountered a Wizard, who uh Did some magic on her."
1346,203-1,And um Provide her with um.
1347,203-1,Magic slipper.

1358,37-1,And uh Oh sorry.
1359,37-1,He left town.
1360,37-1,and basically the stepmother became the evil stepmother.
1361,37-1,And her two daughters were nasty.
1362,37-1,and uh basically reduced Cinderella to a servant in the household.
1363,37-1,"Uh, they were always Giving her commands and lousy things to do."
1364,37-1,"Uh,."
1365,37-1,but along the way she made friends with the critters in the house and in the barnyard.
1366,37-1,Because she was a nice person.
1367,37-1,And uh so that was the situation.

1373,37-1,Ladies to Come to a ball at the palace.

1375,37-1,"Um, We're all excited."
1376,37-1,about doing it.
1377,37-1,"And so was Cinderella,."
1378,37-1,but of course they told her.
1379,37-1,that she couldn't go to the ball.
1380,37-1,"Um, finally at 1."
1381,37-1,"They said, well,."
1382,37-1,"if you get all your chores done, You can go to the ball."
1383,37-1,"So she rushed around, got all her chores done."

1392,37-1,and pulling at the dress.
1393,37-1,and uh uh basically destroyed the dress.
1394,37-1,"So, uh, of course, she was quite distraught."
1395,37-1,"Uh, meanwhile, the mice and uh the other critters."
1396,37-1,"that she'd become friends with, uh, took everything back up to the attic."
1397,37-1,And made a dress for her.
1398,37-1,"Uh, Uh, and the only thing I remember."
1399,37-1,"that is Cinderelli, Cinderelli make a dress for Cinderelli."
1400,37-1,"Anyway, moving along, uh, She could not get the, they could not get the dress done on time."
1401,37-1,So she was so distraught and she was out in the garden.
1402,37-1,crying.
1403,37-1,and uh a woman appeared.
1404,37-1,and said she was her fairy godmother.
1405,37-1,"And Uh, again, set to a lovely tune, uh, the fairy godmother proceeded to turn the pumpkin in the backyard and the critters into a beautiful coach with footmen and drivers and horses, and uh."
1406,37-1,Then used her magic to turn in Cinderella's dress into a beautiful ball gown.
1407,37-1,And so off to the ball she went.
1408,37-1,And uh she got to the ball.
1409,37-1,and was immediately she stood out amongst the uh the maidens there at the ball.
1410,37-1,"Prince caught her eye, they danced."
1411,37-1,and Walked.
1412,37-1,and talked.
1413,37-1,and fell in love.
1414,37-1,"Uh,."
1415,37-1,"and she suddenly realized,."
1416,37-1,"as she was told by the fairy godmother previously, that the magic was only good until midnight,."
1417,37-1,and she saw.
1418,37-1,"that it was starting to be midnight,."
1419,37-1,"and ran out of the palace pursued by the prime minister, uh,."
1420,37-1,and lost one of her glass slippers.
1421,37-1,"Uh, And so the next day, the King and the prime minister, uh, and the prince."
1422,37-1,"Uh, all declared."
1423,37-1,that they were going to find the person.
1424,37-1,Who lost the glass slipper.
1425,37-1,"Uh,."
1426,37-1,And started to go around to every maiden's house in the in the uh kingdom.
1427,37-1,To see which foot fit the slipper.
1428,37-1,"Uh,."
1429,37-1,"And they finally got to Cinderella's house, but of course, the evil stepmother."
1430,37-1,"Uh, had surmised at this point that it was Cinderella."
1431,37-1,And tried to sabotage uh the fitting of the slipper on Cinderella.
1432,37-1,"by first locking her away,."
1433,37-1,and I believe the the mice were the ones.
1434,37-1,"that sprung her from her room, um."
1435,37-1,"And so, uh, on the way to fit the glass slipper, the uh prime minister was tripped by the evil stepmother,."
1436,37-1,"and the slipper crashed, and of course, cause it was glass, broke into 1000 pieces."
1437,37-1,And uh so it looked for all the world.
1438,37-1,"like Cinderella was not gonna get her happy ending, uh,."
1439,37-1,but then she reached into her pocket.
1440,37-1,"and said, well,."
1441,37-1,"that 's OK, I've got another one,."
1442,37-1,and put it on and uh.
1443,37-1,"Married the prince, uh, made the stepmother and the two stepsisters as servants in the palace,."
1444,37-1,and married her prince.
1445,37-1,and lived happily ever after.
1446,wright09a,OK.
1447,wright09a,"This is a story about Cinderella, a nice young lady."
1448,wright09a,"She wanted to go to the ball,."
1449,wright09a,but she had lived with an evil stepmom and 3 evil stepsisters.
1450,wright09a,"Um, She was made to clean the house."
1451,wright09a,while the stepsisters got ready for the ball.
1452,wright09a,Somehow she found an invitation to go to the ball.
1453,wright09a,or someone invited her.
1454,wright09a,She went to the ball.
1455,wright09a,And looked very pretty.
1456,wright09a,and suddenly a prince rode up.
1457,wright09a,"and said, I'm looking for this person."
1458,wright09a,It was supposed to be my princess.
1459,wright09a,I know it's her.
1460,wright09a,if her foot fits in the shoe.
1461,wright09a,He came over.
1462,wright09a,and tried to shoe on Cinderella.
1463,wright09a,It was the right fit.
1464,wright09a,"and it turned out that was his princess,."
1465,wright09a,and they went off.
1466,wright09a,and she became a gold digger.
1467,wright09a,They settled down.
1468,29-1,Cinderella ended up living with uh her stepmother.
1469,29-1,And there were 2 stepsisters.
1470,29-1,that she had.
1471,29-1,And they did not treat Cinderella the same.
1472,29-1,as they did the stepsisters.
1473,29-1,So Cinderella.
1474,29-1,She was a very sweet girl and she was compliant with what was asked of her.
1475,29-1,"There was a special ball coming up,."
1476,29-1,"and this the stepsisters who were really rather wicked, were getting themselves all prepared for the ball,."
1477,29-1,"and Cinderella was wondering if she'd be able to go,."
1478,29-1,and the fairy godmother came along.
1479,29-1,and uh made sure she had a dress and was able to go off to the ball.
1480,29-1,"So she went separately off to the ball,."
1481,29-1,"and when she got there, There was a requirement."
1482,29-1,"that she had to be home by midnight,."
1483,29-1,"and she was given the opportunity to dance with the prince,."
1484,29-1,"and the prince was looking for uh someone that he might be able to live with forever after,."
1485,29-1,"and he enjoyed dancing with Cinderella,."
1486,29-1,as it started to approach.
1487,29-1,"Midnight, Cinderella had to run out."
1488,29-1,because she knew she had to be home.
1489,29-1,That was the condition in which she was able to go to the ball.
1490,29-1,"as she left, she ran so fast."
1491,29-1,that she lost her shoe.
1492,29-1,"So when she got home, it turns out."
1493,29-1,that the prince was really enthralled with her.
1494,29-1,and wanted to find her.
1495,29-1,and Meet her again.
1496,29-1,and had no way.
1497,29-1,of knowing who she was.
1498,29-1,and where she came from except for the red slipper.
1499,29-1,that she had lost on her way out.
1500,29-1,So slowly he began to figure out how he could find Cinderella.
1501,29-1,by using that slipper.
1502,29-1,And he was able to match the slipper with Cinderella.
1503,29-1,"And throughout all this, the wicked stepsisters were not happy."
1504,29-1,that it appeared.
1505,29-1,"that Cinderella was favored by the prince, and she, they were not."
1506,29-1,"Uh, in the end, Cinderella."
1507,29-1,and the prince didn't meet up.
1508,29-1,They married.
1509,29-1,"and they lived happily ever after, much to the chagrin of the two stepsisters who weren't happy at all."
1510,278-1,"OK, well, Cinderella lives in the house with her stepsisters and her stepmother, and she kind of is like the servant maid sort of, she's cleaning up, she's um She's taking care of them and in the house, and the stepsisters are kind of mean to her."
1511,278-1,"They're harsh speaking,."
1512,278-1,and they're always telling her what to do.
1513,278-1,And then the stepmother finds out.
1514,278-1,that there's going to be a ball for the prince and the king.
1515,278-1,"and the queen are are inviting, you know, everyone in the town in the village."
1516,278-1,"So the stepsists all excited and ready to go, and Cinderella's asking,."
1517,278-1,"and they're telling her no, she can't go."
1518,278-1,So she's sad.
1519,278-1,and she goes out and talks to the animals who are her friends.
1520,278-1,"and tells them, you know, why she's sad."
1521,278-1,"and she's, you know,."
1522,278-1,cause they look after her.
1523,278-1,and she looks after them.
1524,278-1,And then her fairy godmother appears.
1525,278-1,"and tells her, well, I think we're gonna make it."
1526,278-1,that you can go to the ball.
1527,278-1,and then she starts doing her magic.
1528,278-1,and turns the pumpkin into a chariot.
1529,278-1,and then she has a chauffeur.
1530,278-1,And then she gives her this beautiful dress and these and these beautiful shoes and everything to get her ready.
1531,278-1,"after the uh, this is of course all."
1532,278-1,"after the step sisters, everybody leaves for the ball."
1533,278-1,And then she's ready to go to the ball.
1534,278-1,and she goes to the ball in the chariot.
1535,278-1,And she goes inside.
1536,278-1,and then the prince sees her.
1537,278-1,after he rolls around the room with the other folks and other ladies.
1538,278-1,and he sees her.
1539,278-1,and he's drawn to her.
1540,278-1,So they dance.
1541,278-1,and then he's fascinated by her.
1542,278-1,"and then she remembers, oh, I have to leave."
1543,278-1,and she's running out.
1544,278-1,and he's chasing her.
1545,278-1,and then she loses her shoe.
1546,278-1,And gets in the chair.
1547,278-1,and gets back home.
1548,278-1,and everything turns back to the way it was.
1549,278-1,And then the prince goes to the town looking for her with the shoe.
1550,278-1,And uh.
1551,278-1,He finds her.
1552,278-1,and he goes to the house.
1553,278-1,and he puts the shoe on.
1554,278-1,She turns back to the princess.
1555,278-1,that he saw.
1556,278-1,and then they go back.
1557,278-1,and then they embrace.
1558,278-1,and enjoy each other.
1559,278-1,and then they live happily ever.
1560,220-1,Cinderella was a lovely young lady who unfortunately lost her mom.
1561,220-1,and had.
1562,220-1,to live with her stepmom and stepsisters.
1563,220-1,I say unfortunately.
1564,220-1,because they thought of Cinderella more as a servant.
1565,220-1,to help them.
1566,220-1,and take care of them.
1567,220-1,as opposed to being any part of the family or a significant human being in their family.
1568,220-1,So they treated her.
1569,220-1,"Uh, with the stain,."
1570,220-1,and they ordered her around.
1571,220-1,They made her do work.
1572,220-1,We never let her do anything fun.
1573,220-1,But Cinderella had a wonderful imagination.
1574,220-1,"She was full of joy,."
1575,220-1,"and she still, still tried."
1576,220-1,to find happiness in every day.
1577,220-1,and tried.
1578,220-1,to do what she could.
1579,220-1,to help both the stepmom.
1580,220-1,and stepsisters feel good.
1581,220-1,And then one day the prince.
1582,220-1,Of the land needed.
1583,220-1,to find a wife.
1584,220-1,And so he was going out.
1585,220-1,"to find who his wife should be,."
1586,220-1,and he had this beautiful glass slipper.
1587,220-1,that he was going.
1588,220-1,"to try on every woman, single woman in the kingdom."
1589,220-1,to see who might be the one who's a perfect fit for him.
1590,220-1,And Cinderella was enthralled.
1591,220-1,and was dreaming of.
1592,220-1,Being able.
1593,220-1,"to participate in this, but of course her stepmom,."
1594,220-1,and um I think stepsisters had nothing.
1595,220-1,to do with.
1596,220-1,had other ideas.
1597,220-1,Instead they wanted Cinderella.
1598,220-1,to help the two ugly sisters get ready for the the opportunity and meantime they were um.
1599,220-1,"Meantime, Anytime, Cinderella helped as best we could, and then."
1600,220-1,"after they had left, uh, her fairy grandmother came and actually with the help of several like mice and others, she was able."
1601,220-1,"to dress Cinderella in a beautiful dress, make her up."
1602,220-1,and make.
1603,220-1,So beautiful.
1604,220-1,"and then she got a, a pumpkin."
1605,220-1,and made it into a beautiful carriage.
1606,220-1,Some mice were turned some mice were turned into uh dos and for the pumpkin as well.
1607,220-1,Coachman for her pumpkin as well as horses for the pumpkin.
1608,220-1,"and Sis went to the ball and Well ultimately, uh, was able."
1609,220-1,to try on the glass slipper.
1610,220-1,and it fit perfectly.
1611,220-1,"but the whole problem with all this, she had to be home by 12 by the time the clock struck 12, and when the spell would be over."
1612,220-1,The pumpkin would turn back into a pump the pumpkin coach would turn back into a pumpkin.
1613,220-1,"She would lose all of her regalia and beautiful garments and beauty, and it would be back into her servant clothes."
1614,220-1,and the mice would become worse.
1615,220-1,"And so just about the time, um, When she discovered."
1616,220-1,"and the prince had discovered this may be her is perfect match with her fitting perfectly into the slipper, she The start plot began to strike 12."
1617,220-1,and she realized how time it was.
1618,220-1,"and ran down the stairs, ran out."
1619,220-1,"and got in the pumpkin,."
1620,220-1,"but in the process, she lost one of the slippers."
1621,220-1,and so um She made it home.
1622,220-1,"And quite frankly, I'm not, I'm trying to blank right now in terms of how the prince finally found her again,."
1623,220-1,but he did.
1624,220-1,"Mom and the step stepmoms and the sisters were very upset by it,."
1625,220-1,but she became uh wedded to the prince.
1626,220-1,and lived happily ever.
1627,neural62-1,"Right, I feel."
1628,neural62-1,"like there'll be a few pages missing,."
1629,neural62-1,but Cinderella comes to live.
1630,neural62-1,"And it appears it's her father,."
1631,neural62-1,"although he never seems to appear again, uh,."
1632,neural62-1,but she shows up.
1633,neural62-1,"and meets her new stepmother and the wicked stepsisters, and instead."
1634,neural62-1,"of welcoming her, they treat her as a maid."
1635,neural62-1,"and she has to serve them, etc."
1636,neural62-1,"and They basically are rather abusive, um."
1637,neural62-1,"Down the road, the wicked stepmother gets an invitation to the ball,."
1638,neural62-1,and the ball is.
1639,neural62-1,that the prince can be looking for a wife.
1640,neural62-1,because his father thinks it's time.
1641,neural62-1,"So , Cinderella thinks she's going to go and everybody's all busy getting dressed."
1642,neural62-1,"and buying new things,."
1643,neural62-1,and she's making do out of the attic with what she can find.
1644,neural62-1,"And when the stepsisters see her in her homemade dress, they, the stepmother says she can't go."
1645,neural62-1,"So , they all take off for the ball, and in the meantime, the mice."
1646,neural62-1,and the fairy godmother appear.
1647,neural62-1,"and Pull together a pumpkin carriage and horses and a beautiful gown for her,."
1648,neural62-1,and off she goes to the ball.
1649,neural62-1,"I feel, I know I'm missing things,."
1650,neural62-1,but she appears at the ball.
1651,neural62-1,"and the prince is taken with her,."
1652,neural62-1,"and she has on these beautiful shoes, and all is fine,."
1653,neural62-1,and he is doting on her.
1654,neural62-1,until She has to be back by midnight.
1655,neural62-1,"because the spell will wear off, and all of a sudden it's almost midnight."
1656,neural62-1,She hears the bell ringing.
1657,neural62-1,and runs down the steps.
1658,neural62-1,and loses one of the beautiful glass slippers she's wearing.
1659,neural62-1,"So the next day, she gets home in time, but the next day, the prince is brokenhearted."
1660,neural62-1,"He wants this lady, and he, all he has is a slipper."
1661,neural62-1,"So they go around the town with the slipper, trying it on everyone."
1662,neural62-1,"of course, the, the sisters think it's going to fit them, so they're up."
1663,neural62-1,"for trying,."
1664,neural62-1,"but the, uh, the age, the prince puts a slipper on her foot, on Cinderella's foot,."
1665,neural62-1,and it fits perfectly.
1666,neural62-1,And all is undone.
1667,neural62-1,and she ends up wedding the prince.
1668,neural62-1,and lives happily ever after.
1669,62-1,"But basically, the story of Cinderella is about a young lady who was um."
1670,62-1,"Uh, her father married a lady who already had two daughters, so she became a stepdaughter, and her stepsisters were not very, and her stepmother were not very, um."
1671,62-1,"Um, nice to her at all."
1672,62-1,They treated her very badly.
1673,62-1,and made her do a lot of the work around the house.
1674,62-1,"and basically treated her, um, very, very cruelly."
1675,62-1,"And , um,."
1676,62-1,"as she grew, uh grew up, she became friends, uh, with several of the animals."
1677,62-1,"that lived in the house, the mice and Um, Uh different animals, so bottom line is she was friends with them."
1678,62-1,They were really the only friends.
1679,62-1,that she had.
1680,62-1,"And one day, Um, there was a big ball."
1681,62-1,that was gonna be going on.
1682,62-1,and the prince was going to select a.
1683,62-1,Wife.
1684,62-1,"for himself, so all the ladies in the village wanted to dress up in their finest gowns."
1685,62-1,and go to this ball.
1686,62-1,"And Cinderella wanted to go as well,."
1687,62-1,"but her stepmother said no, she couldn't go, she wasn't allowed."
1688,62-1,"So her friends, the mice, helped to make a beautiful gown for her."
1689,62-1,"And meanwhile, they um plotted to get her to the ball."
1690,62-1,and she was taken to the ball by her uh fairy godmother.
1691,62-1,"Um, who came."
1692,62-1,and made a carriage out of a pumpkin.
1693,62-1,"and made horses out of, I forget what she made the horses out of, but maybe some of the mice."
1694,62-1,"And anyway, they, she went to the ball."
1695,62-1,"And um she even had on um beautiful a glass slipper, slippers and so."
1696,62-1,She went to the ball and uh the prince.
1697,62-1,"Um, really admired her,."
1698,62-1,"but she was, she had to be home by midnight."
1699,62-1,"because if she wasn't, all of the."
1700,62-1,"Um, pumpkin in there, and the horses and everything, and even her gown."
1701,62-1,"and everything was gonna go back to where it was, it disappear."
1702,62-1,So the clock was striking midnight.
1703,62-1,"and she was trying to get away from the ball, so she, in fact, um, ran."
1704,62-1,and lost one of her slippers.
1705,62-1,She did manage to get back home.
1706,62-1,"And the prince ended up finding, they found a slipper,."
1707,62-1,and they were trying to find the young lady.
1708,62-1,that owned this slipper.
1709,62-1,"that was who he really did, um, I guess, want to get to know better."
1710,62-1,or marry.
1711,62-1,"Um, So, they put out an announcement."
1712,62-1,"that they were coming around with this slipper,."
1713,62-1,"and whoever's foot fit the slipper wasn't gonna, in fact, gonna be who they identified as being um Cinderella."
1714,62-1,So they came around to her house and her mom.
1715,62-1,"and stepsisters did not want her to try on, of course, they didn't know she'd even been to the ball."
1716,62-1,So they saw no reason.
1717,62-1,for her to try on the slipper.
1718,62-1,It didn't fit any of their feet.
1719,62-1,But um the gentleman.
1720,62-1,"that bought the slipper with the prince was like, let, let's try this on."
1721,62-1,"Um,."
1722,62-1,and so they sat her down.
1723,62-1,"and tried on the slipper,."
1724,62-1,"and of course, it fit perfectly."
1725,62-1,"And they knew that this was in fact, um, Cinderella."
1726,62-1,So she.
1727,62-1,"and the prince, um, Met up."
1728,62-1,and got married.
1729,62-1,and live happily ever after.
1730,208-1,Once a She was a young woman.
1731,208-1,"Who lived with a wicked stepmother and her two daughters, Funilla."
1732,208-1,and somebody can't remember the other name.
1733,208-1,"Um, She was delegated to a room all by herself."
1734,208-1,"She was not, I'm just remembering this from what I'm reading many years ago."
1735,208-1,"Um,."
1736,208-1,"and she was not included in any family activities except to clean, wash, iron, do lots of chores."
1737,208-1,"Um, the girls could not stand her."
1738,208-1,"Uh, the mother could not stand her,."
1739,208-1,"but they got, they got a lot of work out of her."
1740,208-1,"Um, In the neighborhood,."
1741,208-1,"if you will, there was a a a a castle where a prince lived,."
1742,208-1,and he was in search of the love of his life.
1743,208-1,"And I'm skipping a lot of things I realized, um,."
1744,208-1,"but anyway, he went to a ball."
1745,208-1,"and he saw this young woman who was absolutely lovely,."
1746,208-1,and at 12 o'clock she disappeared.
1747,208-1,"and she ran down the steps to her carriage, which had been a pumpkin,."
1748,208-1,if I recall correctly.
1749,208-1,And um.
1750,208-1,in order to find him.
1751,208-1,because he realized she was the one.
1752,208-1,"And she had dropped her glass slipper,."
1753,208-1,"and he had that, and that was the criteria."
1754,208-1,"for finding her, so he went from town to town, house to house,."
1755,208-1,and when he got to the wicked stepmother's house.
1756,208-1,It did not fit Pruella and her sister.
1757,208-1,"Although they did everything they could to squeeze their fat feet into the shoe, um,."
1758,208-1,but it did fit Cinderella's foot.
1759,208-1,And eventually they lived happily and brand.
1760,neural38-1,OK.
1761,neural38-1,"Once upon a time, There was a."
1762,neural38-1,Unpleasant woman with two unpleasant daughters.
1763,neural38-1,"Who Apparently Uh, was given a very nice daughter by a mysterious."
1764,neural38-1,Gentleman who didn't Want to take care of her anymore.
1765,neural38-1,The two unpleasant daughters.
1766,neural38-1,Didn't do much of the work around the house.
1767,neural38-1,and Were unpleasant to the nice daughter who was Stuck having to do.
1768,neural38-1,"All the unpleasant tasks around the house,."
1769,neural38-1,"but Had some robot mice to keep her company, who it helped a lot with her sanity in this unpleasant situation."
1770,neural38-1,"Meanwhile, at the castle, The prince is being badgered by."
1771,neural38-1,"His, uh, Odd looking father."
1772,neural38-1,"that he must have a wife to be princess,."
1773,neural38-1,"that The, uh Evil patriarchy can continue on through history of the rule of the land."
1774,neural38-1,The prince It's going to have a big party.
1775,neural38-1,and invite all the eligible.
1776,neural38-1,"Um, Young women In the land that is all the Women of the proper class."
1777,neural38-1,"And uh And race, creed, religion, and all the other important things to a prince."
1778,neural38-1,"So , uh, a declaration is set out, there is going to be a great ball from which at which occasion, the prince will will uh observe."
1779,neural38-1,"and perhaps dance with all the, hopefully eligible young women of The nation and Uh,."
1780,neural38-1,"as this happens, the unfortunate, uh, Nice Daughter Learns of it."
1781,neural38-1,and thinks maybe she could go.
1782,neural38-1,"and uh In an old chest, she finds."
1783,neural38-1,An old book.
1784,neural38-1,Which may.
1785,neural38-1,"or may not have anything to do with the story,."
1786,neural38-1,but she also finds a great dress.
1787,neural38-1,that she can wear.
1788,neural38-1,"Now, the evil daughters."
1789,neural38-1,They see her thinking that she has plans to go.
1790,neural38-1,"and they say, no, I know you're not gonna go, you're just the ugly."
1791,neural38-1,"Daughter who does all the chores,."
1792,neural38-1,and you're not going to go to a great ball.
1793,neural38-1,"So , they and the unpleasant mother."
1794,neural38-1,"Head off to the ball, to have a great time."
1795,neural38-1,and hopefully attract the prince's attention And uh.
1796,neural38-1,"and have things go their way,."
1797,neural38-1,"but meanwhile, The, the nice daughter stuck with all the terrible chores in the household."
1798,neural38-1,"Uh, is visited by a fairy godmother."
1799,neural38-1,Who Realize.
1800,neural38-1,that there's a big problem.
1801,neural38-1,and She decides.
1802,neural38-1,"that she needs the help,."
1803,neural38-1,"and She gives The Pretty nice and badly treated daughter, a beautiful dress,."
1804,neural38-1,"and takes her to the ball, and of course, the prince."
1805,neural38-1,Sees.
1806,neural38-1,that there's this.
1807,neural38-1,"Beautiful and virtuous woman who he's never met before,."
1808,neural38-1,"and he wants to know who she is,."
1809,neural38-1,"and Um, they dance."
1810,neural38-1,"and they They have a wonderful time,."
1811,neural38-1,"but pretty soon, The clock shows it's almost midnight."
1812,neural38-1,"And according to the legal stipulations of her contract with the fairy godmother, she must be home before 12, or else."
1813,neural38-1,"Uh, her beautiful carriage drawn by the goofiest horses ever."
1814,neural38-1,"Well suddenly turn into a pumpkin, and it's rather hard to get home in a pumpkin."
1815,neural38-1,"So , She rushes home."
1816,neural38-1,"And at some point the carriage does turn into a pumpkin, I believe I've kind of lost it there,."
1817,neural38-1,but She gets home.
1818,neural38-1,"and On the way home, she lost one of her beautiful slippers."
1819,neural38-1,"And She doesn't realize it at the time, That 's actually a good thing to lose a slipper because In the following days, the prince, who's very upset because This woman who was the most charming and wonderful woman at the ball, he would like to see her again, he'd like her to become princess,."
1820,neural38-1,"but She vanished, and the only thing left is The slipper."
1821,neural38-1,that you lost.
1822,neural38-1,"Unfortunately, it didn't hit anything hard on the ground, or it would have just been a pile of glass shards."
1823,neural38-1,But he has a slipper.
1824,neural38-1,and he makes the rounds.
1825,neural38-1,"Of, uh, every household in the country."
1826,neural38-1,"Of course, not including the lower class ones or the households that were."
1827,neural38-1,that were uh Owned by immigrants or Foreigners who were had been living there.
1828,neural38-1,"but couldn't become citizens, if the other riffraff, but just the."
1829,neural38-1,The households with Eligible women who could By means of class B.
1830,neural38-1,"His princess And when they get to uh where our heroine lives, The uh the bad."
1831,neural38-1,"Women Try on the slipper,."
1832,neural38-1,"and of course it doesn't fit,."
1833,neural38-1,"but it fits on our heroine, who Is then Understood to be the woman."
1834,neural38-1,"that the prince danced with at the ball, And all is well with the world."
1835,neural5-1,OK.
1836,neural5-1,"Uh, once upon a time there was, um, a woman who had two daughters."
1837,neural5-1,"She married a man who had a daughter of his own, and when they came to live together, um, the two daughters of the woman were very, very unkind and , and we're not happy."
1838,neural5-1,about having this other girl come live with them.
1839,neural5-1,"So, in fact, they made her do all the work and all of the chores."
1840,neural5-1,"This other girl, the new, the daughter of the husband, her name was Cinderella, um,."
1841,neural5-1,and they made her do lots and lots of work.
1842,neural5-1,"She was very, very kind, however, to the animals because they were really the only friends she had."
1843,neural5-1,"Well, Cinderella looked out the window one day where she saw the palace,."
1844,neural5-1,"and what was happening in the palace at the time was that the prince, uh, was it was time for the prince to be married,."
1845,neural5-1,and so his father was saying.
1846,neural5-1,"that they he needed to decide who he was going to marry, so they decided to have a ball, where they would invite all the young ladies from the town or the village."
1847,neural5-1,So an invitation went out to Cinderella's family.
1848,neural5-1,"Her stepmother received the invitation,."
1849,neural5-1,"and her stepmother told her daughters about it, who got very excited,."
1850,neural5-1,"but they didn't really say anything to Cinderella,."
1851,neural5-1,and the daughters started preparing their dresses.
1852,neural5-1,"and getting the things ready for the ball,."
1853,neural5-1,but they were not going to give a dress to Cinderella.
1854,neural5-1,"So she went into her treasure chest, she opened up a book."
1855,neural5-1,"and had some old fabric in it,."
1856,neural5-1,and she looked at.
1857,neural5-1,and decided to make herself a dress for the ball.
1858,neural5-1,But then when the time came.
1859,neural5-1,"for the sisters to all go to the ball, they said, oh, you need to fix my dress,."
1860,neural5-1,"and you need to fix my dress,."
1861,neural5-1,"and they ripped things from Cinderella's dress to use on theirs,."
1862,neural5-1,"and before long, she had nothing to wear to the ball,."
1863,neural5-1,and they were not going to have her go with them.
1864,neural5-1,So off the sisters went.
1865,neural5-1,"Cinderella was so sad, she went out into the garden."
1866,neural5-1,"And there she saw, happened to see a a pumpkin and , and the mice,."
1867,neural5-1,"and pretty soon, uh, a fairy godmother appeared,."
1868,neural5-1,"and the fairy godmother said to Cinderella some magical words,."
1869,neural5-1,"and she turned the pumpkin into a carriage, she turned the mice into horses."
1870,neural5-1,"or something, or horses,."
1871,neural5-1,"and she turned Cinderella, uh, ripped up clothes into a beautiful gown."
1872,neural5-1,"Cinderella went to the ball,."
1873,neural5-1,"but the fairy godmother said, you must leave by midnight,."
1874,neural5-1,because then the the coach will become a pumpkin.
1875,neural5-1,and your dress will turn back to rags.
1876,neural5-1,"Cinderella walked into the ball, and the prince."
1877,neural5-1,"and she began to dance,."
1878,neural5-1,"but at midnight, the clock struck."
1879,neural5-1,"and she knew she had to leave, so she ran out of the castle, she ran down the steps,."
1880,neural5-1,"and when she did, she ran right out of one of her glass slippers."
1881,neural5-1,She ran.
1882,neural5-1,and ran into the fields.
1883,neural5-1,"until indeed her dress returned to rags,."
1884,neural5-1,and the coach turned back into a pumpkin.
1885,neural5-1,And one of the mice had a key.
1886,neural5-1,"for some, oh, I know,."
1887,neural5-1,cause I guess they locked her up or something.
1888,neural5-1,"I can't remember why, what was going on in that picture,."
1889,neural5-1,"but they, uh, the mice unlocked the key."
1890,neural5-1,"Oh yeah,."
1891,neural5-1,"cause the prince was coming to, um, to see whose foot fit that glass slipper,."
1892,neural5-1,"because he knew that was the woman he wanted to marry,."
1893,neural5-1,"and when he arrived at the house, he tried the shoe, uh, they tried the shoe on the two sisters,."
1894,neural5-1,and it didn't fit.
1895,neural5-1,"Uh,."
1896,neural5-1,"but Cinderella was locked up,."
1897,neural5-1,"but the mice found the key, unlocked Cinderella's room, so she came running down."
1898,neural5-1,"She tried on the slipper, it fit,."
1899,neural5-1,and then the prince knew that she was the one he wanted to marry.
1900,neural5-1,They married.
1901,neural5-1,"and lived,."
1902,neural5-1,"as all fairy tales say, happily ever after."
1903,neural20-1,"Once upon a time, there was a widower who had a young daughter,."
1904,neural20-1,and he decided.
1905,neural20-1,to remarry.
1906,neural20-1,The woman.
1907,neural20-1,"that he chose had 2 daughters herself, and then they were a family."
1908,neural20-1,"But the mother, the, the stepmother to the little girl was not kind to the little girl whose name was Cinderella."
1909,neural20-1,"And in fact, her two daughters were equally unkind."
1910,neural20-1,They were very cruel.
1911,neural20-1,They insisted.
1912,neural20-1,"that Cinderella do her laundry, do their laundry."
1913,neural20-1,And bring them tea whenever they wanted.
1914,neural20-1,"One day, uh, Cinderella was looking, looking out the window at the At the palace at the uh Palace far, far away in the distance, the castle where the prince lived."
1915,neural20-1,"And one day, the family received a letter in the mail, an invitation,."
1916,neural20-1,because the king had become very concerned.
1917,neural20-1,that he had not found a suitable wife for his son.
1918,neural20-1,so he decided.
1919,neural20-1,"to give a ball, a big dance,."
1920,neural20-1,and he would invite all the young women in the kingdom.
1921,neural20-1,so he sent out his invitations.
1922,neural20-1,And one arrived at the home of the widower and the stepmother and the 3 daughters.
1923,neural20-1,And the two older daughters were excited about this.
1924,neural20-1,We will go to the ball.
1925,neural20-1,"Maybe the, maybe the prince will choose one of us."
1926,neural20-1,And Cinderella was looking over their shoulder.
1927,neural20-1,and she was also reading the invitation.
1928,neural20-1,"and she thought, well, I could go that too."
1929,neural20-1,"so we, she went up to her room."
1930,neural20-1,and she looked in her trunk.
1931,neural20-1,She looked through all of her things.
1932,neural20-1,"and she found a dress, a pink and white dress."
1933,neural20-1,that she thought probably would work.
1934,neural20-1,"And now the animals in this household were very sympathetic to Cinderella,."
1935,neural20-1,"and the two little mice were watching,."
1936,neural20-1,and they were cheering her on.
1937,neural20-1,"So Cinderella put on her lovely pink and white gown,."
1938,neural20-1,and she went downstairs.
1939,neural20-1,"to show the other,."
1940,neural20-1,to show the stepmother and the two stepsisters.
1941,neural20-1,"When they saw her, they were irate and angry,."
1942,neural20-1,"and they said, you cannot go to the ball with us."
1943,neural20-1,"You're just a Cinderella, you're just a little chambermaid."
1944,neural20-1,And with.
1945,neural20-1,"that , they began."
1946,neural20-1,to rip off the ribbons and the other fancy attire.
1947,neural20-1,so Cinderella had.
1948,neural20-1,"to go back up to her room, and the the stepmother and the stepsisters, not only."
1949,neural20-1,"that , they locked her in her room,."
1950,neural20-1,that there was no possibility of her leaving.
1951,neural20-1,to go with them when they went off to the ball.
1952,neural20-1,"And Cinderella sat in her room weeping suddenly, do do do do do."
1953,neural20-1,"Sparkling stardust fell upon the room,."
1954,neural20-1,and there appeared the fairy godmother.
1955,neural20-1,"And the fairy godmother said, why are you weeping, Cinderella?"
1956,neural20-1,It's because my evil stepsisters.
1957,neural20-1,and my stepmother will not allow me.
1958,neural20-1,"to go to the ball,."
1959,neural20-1,and I wanted so much.
1960,neural20-1,"to go,."
1961,neural20-1,"and they tore apart my apart my dress,."
1962,neural20-1,and now I have nothing.
1963,neural20-1,to wear.
1964,neural20-1,"Oh yes, you do, said the step, said the fairy godmother."
1965,neural20-1,And with.
1966,neural20-1,"that , she waved her magic wand."
1967,neural20-1,"and stardust fell all over the room,."
1968,neural20-1,"and suddenly, Cinderella was clothed in the most beautiful white gown,."
1969,neural20-1,"and her hair was done up in a very fancy hairstyle with a hairband, and she was absolutely beautiful,."
1970,neural20-1,and the little mice cheered.
1971,neural20-1,"and said, how wonderful she looked."
1972,neural20-1,"And Cinderella said,."
1973,neural20-1,but I have no way.
1974,neural20-1,to get to the ball.
1975,neural20-1,"Oh yes, you do, said the fairy godmother."
1976,neural20-1,And with.
1977,neural20-1,"that , she waved her magic wand again, do do do do do."
1978,neural20-1,"and stardust fell all over the, all over the room, and now Cinderella was now outside in the courtyard,."
1979,neural20-1,"and there the pumpkin had been turned into a beautiful carriage,."
1980,neural20-1,"and the little mice became her footman, and the dog was there as her special servant."
1981,neural20-1,"And the horse, excuse me, the horse."
1982,neural20-1,"Suddenly there were 6 horses, and all."
1983,neural20-1,of them were attired in beautiful plumage.
1984,neural20-1,"And they became the, the horses."
1985,neural20-1,that would draw the golden pumpkin carriage.
1986,neural20-1,So the fairy godmother helped Cinderella.
1987,neural20-1,"to climb up into the carriage,."
1988,neural20-1,and off they went to the ball.
1989,neural20-1,"Once they got there, the um Meyerdomo, I'm not sure what."
1990,neural20-1,"to call him, but the man who welcomed the guests."
1991,neural20-1,"Said, oh, who are you?"
1992,neural20-1,and brought Cinderella up into the ballroom.
1993,neural20-1,"And when the prince saw her come in, he dropped his attention to the stepsisters and all the other women in the room,?"
1994,neural20-1,and he was suddenly struck with awe at this gorgeous creature?
1995,neural20-1,"that had come into the room,?"
1996,neural20-1,and he immediately he went over to her?
1997,neural20-1,"and he said, May I have this dance?"
1998,neural20-1,"And then for the next, for the rest."
1999,neural20-1,"of the ball, the prince danced only with Cinderella."
2000,neural20-1,But then there was a big clock in the room.
2001,neural20-1,because Cinderella had been told by her stepmother.
2002,neural20-1,"that she could go to the ball,."
2003,neural20-1,but she must come home by 12 o'clock.
2004,neural20-1,"because at 12 o'clock, she would go back to being her old self, Cinderella, the one who dusted the the fireplace."
2005,neural20-1,"And now she suddenly looked at the clock, and it was 2 minutes before 12 o'clock,."
2006,neural20-1,"and she said to the prince, Oh, I'm so sorry,."
2007,neural20-1,but I have.
2008,neural20-1,to go.
2009,neural20-1,"No, he said, don't leave."
2010,neural20-1,"And she said, I'm sorry, I have."
2011,neural20-1,And with.
2012,neural20-1,"that , she broke away from him."
2013,neural20-1,"and she ran out of the Out of the castle, the palace, down the steps,."
2014,neural20-1,"as she did, she lost one of her golden, one of her glass slippers."
2015,neural20-1,that had been given to her by the fairy godmother.
2016,neural20-1,"And the Myerdomo, who was in charge."
2017,neural20-1,"of the guests, ran after her."
2018,neural20-1,"and said, no, wait, come back, come back."
2019,neural20-1,"She said, no, I can't,."
2020,neural20-1,"but she had lost her glass slipper slipper,."
2021,neural20-1,but he found it.
2022,neural20-1,and he took it.
2023,neural20-1,"Cinderella got into her carriage, but suddenly, once again, she was just Cinderella."
2024,neural20-1,"And the horses were just that one horse, and the dog was just the dog."
2025,neural20-1,"He was no longer the footman, and the little mice were just little mice again."
2026,neural20-1,But who was that beautiful creature?
2027,neural20-1,thought the prince.
2028,neural20-1,I must find her.
2029,neural20-1,so he sent his emissaries out into the village.
2030,neural20-1,"He had the glass slipper,."
2031,neural20-1,"and he sent his servant, who carried the glass slipper on a pillow."
2032,neural20-1,"And they went to all the young, to the houses of all the young women in the land,."
2033,neural20-1,"and they finally got to the home of Cinderella,."
2034,neural20-1,but Cinderella was locked inside a door up high in her room.
2035,neural20-1,"But Then The footman said, let me try this glass slipper on your daughters, and they were all excited."
2036,neural20-1,"and they stuck out their feet, but their feet were too big for the glass slipper."
2037,neural20-1,And this was the last family in the whole village?
2038,neural20-1,that the footman had?
2039,neural20-1,"and his servant had come to ,?"
2040,neural20-1,"and they said, is there not one more person?"
2041,neural20-1,You must have another person here.
2042,neural20-1,because there aren't any other people in.
2043,neural20-1,Any other young women in the village.
2044,neural20-1,"Oh, yes, said, said the evil stepmother."
2045,neural20-1,"There is one more,."
2046,neural20-1,but you wouldn't want her.
2047,neural20-1,She's just our little Cinderella.
2048,neural20-1,Bring her.
2049,neural20-1,"to me, he shouted."
2050,neural20-1,so they got Cinderella.
2051,neural20-1,"and they brought her down,."
2052,neural20-1,and the evil stepmother tried.
2053,neural20-1,to trip the footman who had the glass slipper on a pillow.
2054,neural20-1,But it was caught in time.
2055,neural20-1,"and it was put onto the foot of Cinderella, and lo."
2056,neural20-1,"and behold, it fit perfectly."
2057,neural20-1,"Oh, we have found her."
2058,neural20-1,And with.
2059,neural20-1,"that , the fairy godmother must have appeared again,."
2060,neural20-1,"because in the last frame, there is Cinderella with the prince,."
2061,neural20-1,and she is.
2062,neural20-1,"once again her beautiful fairy godmother supplied self, and the two."
2063,neural20-1,of them lived happily ever after.
2064,99-1,OK.
2065,99-1,"Once there was a young girl, I believe her name was Aurora,."
2066,99-1,and she was adored by her father.
2067,99-1,"But her mother had passed away,."
2068,99-1,"so her father married a woman who had 2 girls,."
2069,99-1,and they moved into Cinderella's home.
2070,99-1,The father passed away and the stepmother.
2071,99-1,"and the two girls started to treat Cinderella like a servant,."
2072,99-1,and they named her Cinderella.
2073,99-1,because she was always covered in cinders.
2074,99-1,from cleaning the fireplace.
2075,99-1,And they treated her quite cruelly.
2076,99-1,"And um didn't let her do anything fun, but she was um friends with the animals and the birds and the Mice."
2077,99-1,"and she entertained herself and uh with her, the little critters."
2078,99-1,that befriended her.
2079,99-1,So one day an invitation to a ball came to the stepmother who was very excited.
2080,99-1,about taking her daughters to this ball in hopes.
2081,99-1,of meeting the prince.
2082,99-1,"And um And Cinderella was excited about it too,."
2083,99-1,until she was informed.
2084,99-1,that she was not allowed to go.
2085,99-1,"so off goes the stepmother and the and the stepsisters to the ball, and Cinderella is very sad."
2086,99-1,that she can't go.
2087,99-1,until her very godmother came.
2088,99-1,And um I think fairy godmother waved her wand.
2089,99-1,and said bidi bobbity boo.
2090,99-1,"And turned a pumpkin into a coach, turned the mice into horses and coachmen,."
2091,99-1,and waved her wand.
2092,99-1,"and gave um Cinderella a beautiful dress,."
2093,99-1,"and she looked like a princess,."
2094,99-1,and off they went with a warning.
2095,99-1,"that she had to be gone by midnight,."
2096,99-1,cause then all the magic would disappear.
2097,99-1,So she goes to them.
2098,99-1,Ball.
2099,99-1,and the prince sees her.
2100,99-1,and immediately falls.
2101,99-1,"in love with her,."
2102,99-1,and they dance and everybody oos.
2103,99-1,"and aws over how beautiful she is,."
2104,99-1,and they wonder who she is.
2105,99-1,cause they've never seen her.
2106,99-1,But then this clock starts to strike.
2107,99-1,And she ran away.
2108,99-1,"And , in order to be gone."
2109,99-1,"before it hit 12,."
2110,99-1,"as she was running, she dropped her slipper."
2111,99-1,And she ran to the Coach.
2112,99-1,and which took off.
2113,99-1,and eventually it started to disintegrate.
2114,99-1,"as she got home, she was back to her normal self."
2115,99-1,"Well, the prince wanted To find her."
2116,99-1,and commanded that the guards.
2117,99-1,"and everybody go all over the kingdom looking for her,."
2118,99-1,and they took the shoe.
2119,99-1,and uh tried it on every fair maiden who claimed it was theirs.
2120,99-1,and didn't fit anybody.
2121,99-1,"Finally, they got to the stepmother's house with the stepsisters,."
2122,99-1,and the stepmother had locked Cinderella away.
2123,99-1,that she couldn't be seen.
2124,99-1,or know for the.
2125,99-1,People.
2126,99-1,"from the castle wouldn't know she was there,."
2127,99-1,so the girls tried it on.
2128,99-1,and it didn't fit them.
2129,99-1,And um I believe?
2130,99-1,"that they heard her singing and ,?"
2131,99-1,and the guard stopped?
2132,99-1,"and said, who is?"
2133,99-1,And we want to see her.
2134,99-1,"of course, they saw her."
2135,99-1,and she put the slipper on.
2136,99-1,"and fit her,."
2137,99-1,and off she goes to the palace.
2138,99-1,"and marries the prince,."
2139,99-1,and they live happily ever after.
2140,44-1,"OK, from the beginning, so Cinderella was living with her, uh."
2141,44-1,"Uh, sisters, stepsister, I think or stepsisters, they were all, uh."
2142,44-1,"Uh, mean to her."
2143,44-1,"They were, uh, not as pretty as her, they were jealous of her."
2144,44-1,"And there was a uh A ball, a dance to go to,."
2145,44-1,"and , uh, you know, Cinderella didn't have any good clothes to wear."
2146,44-1,"And they uh She was uh Um, kind of sad."
2147,44-1,because she couldn't go.
2148,44-1,"The sisters were mean to her,."
2149,44-1,"and they got all dressed up, they went,."
2150,44-1,"and then Cinderella was left at home, uh."
2151,44-1,Very good godmother appeared.
2152,44-1,"and uh You know, granted Cinderella, a wish."
2153,44-1,"She got dressed up, got all her fancy clothes."
2154,44-1,"Uh, turned the, uh, pumpkin into a carriage."
2155,44-1,"Uh, the carriage, uh, took her to the ball."
2156,44-1,"Of course, she was the prettiest one there."
2157,44-1,"I guess the prince, uh, had the ball, you know, was attracted to her."
2158,44-1,"and , uh, lost one of her slippers, uh, at the, the, the whole thing had to end at a certain time like uh at midnight."
2159,44-1,And then she uh.
2160,44-1,"Ran out of the uh Party, the ball, wherever she was at."
2161,44-1,"And after that, uh,."
2162,44-1,"as she was running out, one of her slippers fell off."
2163,44-1,"And the uh prince, uh wanted to meet her again, so he uh went through the village trying, it was a very small slipper."
2164,44-1,and uh tried to find the person whose foot fit in the slipper.
2165,44-1,"So the uh You know, the stepsisters."
2166,44-1,"or her sisters uh would not fit,."
2167,44-1,and uh then he came to Cinderella that fit perfectly.
2168,44-1,So they uh got together.
2169,44-1,and lived happily ever after.
2170,84-1,OK.
2171,84-1,So Cinderella had lost her mother.
2172,84-1,and her father remarried.
2173,84-1,"She had two stepsisters, and they were very jealous of Cinderella's beauty."
2174,84-1,"and treated her like um the maid,."
2175,84-1,and they made her clean for them.
2176,84-1,and uh clean their rooms.
2177,84-1,"and do all the chores around the house, clean the fireplace, hence Cinderella."
2178,84-1,"Um,."
2179,84-1,and there was in the land.
2180,84-1,"that they lived, uh, there was a prince."
2181,84-1,"and his father, the king, wanted him to marry, so they were going to have this big ball where all the single women in the uh land were going to be invited to the castle."
2182,84-1,and the the um prince would pick out his future princess.
2183,84-1,"And so Cinderella, uh, you know, imagined herself going to the ball just like her stepsisters."
2184,84-1,"as their stepsisters, uh mother was getting them dresses and ,."
2185,84-1,"and so forth, uh, from the dressmaker, Cinderella made her own dress,."
2186,84-1,"and when the time came, uh, she showed them her dress."
2187,84-1,that she had made.
2188,84-1,"and they again with uh jealous rage, they ripped her."
2189,84-1,Her dress to shreds.
2190,84-1,and told her.
2191,84-1,that she would not be going to the ball.
2192,84-1,"And I guess depending on, you know, which version did she really get locked upstairs, I don't know, but um the, she was always very friendly with the animals, um, the birds, the, the mice, the, the, um, the dog."
2193,84-1,"Um, the horse,."
2194,84-1,and so she was crying.
2195,84-1,and they decided.
2196,84-1,that they were going to help her and in the one version.
2197,84-1,"that I remember, the birds, I think, um."
2198,84-1,Uh Made her a very beautiful dress.
2199,84-1,Her fairy godmother came.
2200,84-1,and told her that she would be able to um allow her to go to the The ball.
2201,84-1,"Um, so she took the mice."
2202,84-1,"and she made them into the footsman and the driver,."
2203,84-1,"and she took the horse, she took a pumpkin."
2204,84-1,and made the pumpkin into the carriage.
2205,84-1,She took the dress.
2206,84-1,and made it more beautiful.
2207,84-1,"And she then said to Cinderella, go."
2208,84-1,"and have a wonderful time, but one thing, remember, when the clock strikes 12, you must come home."
2209,84-1,because everything will revert back to what it was.
2210,84-1,And so Cinderella did end up going to the ball.
2211,84-1,And she was the belle of the ball.
2212,84-1,"Everybody was aghast at her beauty and , and her uh dress and everything,."
2213,84-1,and the prince was just smitten by her.
2214,84-1,"and so they danced, they had a wonderful time."
2215,84-1,and she forgot about.
2216,84-1,The time.
2217,84-1,until she heard the bell ring at 12 o'clock.
2218,84-1,"and then she went running out of there, out of the castle."
2219,84-1,and she tripped.
2220,84-1,and dropped one of her glass slippers.
2221,84-1,"and excuse me, and then."
2222,84-1,"as predicted,."
2223,84-1,"once the, the 12th bell, she reverted back to Cinderella with the mice and the dog and the The pumpkin and everything,."
2224,84-1,but the prince was not going to let it end there.
2225,84-1,He wanted his princess.
2226,84-1,and so he set out all through the land.
2227,84-1,that he was sending out his couriers uh.
2228,84-1,With the glass slipper.
2229,84-1,and he was going to marry the woman who would fit into the glass slipper.
2230,84-1,"So all of the women in the land were, you know, very excited."
2231,84-1,that the prince was gonna come around.
2232,84-1,and try the glass slipper on their foot.
2233,84-1,"that 's where I remember, um, Cinderella, I think got locked upstairs, um,."
2234,84-1,"but Anyway, they came around."
2235,84-1,and uh the sisters tried to squeeze their big feet into the glass slippers.
2236,84-1,and they couldn't and um.
2237,84-1,"as he was getting ready to leave, I'm not sure how the door got unlocked."
2238,84-1,"I don't know if it was one of the birds unlocking it,."
2239,84-1,"but anyway, she came downstairs."
2240,84-1,and She put her foot into the slipper.
2241,84-1,"and it fit,."
2242,84-1,"and he took her away into the castle,."
2243,84-1,"and he made her his princess, and happily ever."
2244,84-1,after they lived.
2245,84-1,That 's what I remember.
2246,226-1,"Many years ago, there was a little girl who lived with a very cruel stepmother and two stepsisters,."
2247,226-1,and the family did not accept Cinderella.
2248,226-1,and asked her.
2249,226-1,"to do the work of a maid, while the rest."
2250,226-1,of the family simply enjoyed all of her hard work.
2251,226-1,"As the sisters grew up along with Cinderella, it became very obvious."
2252,226-1,"that Cinderella's life had been constrained to just being a servant, cleaning the floors, taking out the fire, embers,."
2253,226-1,and doing the housework of a maid.
2254,226-1,The sisters oftentimes dreamed.
2255,226-1,"of meeting a handsome prince,."
2256,226-1,and Cinderella did as well.
2257,226-1,"by looking out the window at a beautiful castle in the distance,."
2258,226-1,and wishing that she was able.
2259,226-1,"to go be a princess or even a queen someday, living in the castle instead of being a lowly made servant to the very cruel stepmother and her cruel stepsisters."
2260,226-1,"One day, The word got out that the prince, whose father was the king of the kingdom where they lived, um, in the castle along with Cinderella and the, the stepfamily."
2261,226-1,"and stepmother, began."
2262,226-1,"to , um, began."
2263,226-1,to look for a wife.
2264,226-1,He needed a princess.
2265,226-1,to accompany him.
2266,226-1,and invitations were sent to all of the upper class families in the kingdom.
2267,226-1,"Including the evil stepmother's family, and the sisters were so excited."
2268,226-1,to go to the party where they would get a chance.
2269,226-1,to meet the prince.
2270,226-1,And Cinderella was very sad.
2271,226-1,because she was not excluded.
2272,226-1,And the sisters left and Cinderella was in the garden.
2273,226-1,"by herself, really feeling quite despondent when a fairy godmother appeared to her."
2274,226-1,"And told her if she was kind since she was kind and such a beautiful good person,."
2275,226-1,that she was going.
2276,226-1,"to make her a princess for the party, but she must be home."
2277,226-1,"By midnight,."
2278,226-1,"because at midnight, her carriage would turn back into a pumpkin."
2279,226-1,So she was turned into with the the um clothing of a beautiful princess.
2280,226-1,and had a beautiful carriage.
2281,226-1,to take her to the castle where she went.
2282,226-1,"to the party, fascinated the prince who was just stunned by not only her beauty but her obvious kindness,."
2283,226-1,"and he became quite enamored with her,."
2284,226-1,and they began.
2285,226-1,to dance.
2286,226-1,and laugh.
2287,226-1,and have a wonderful time and suddenly.
2288,226-1,The clock stuck 12.
2289,226-1,and she realized that she was late.
2290,226-1,"and she ran out the door, leaving her slipper."
2291,226-1,"and went home where the carriage became a pumpkin,."
2292,226-1,"and she was back wearing rags, which was what she was given."
2293,226-1,to wear in her servant role to the evil stepmother and cruel sisters stepsisters.
2294,226-1,The prince was so distraught.
2295,226-1,after he realized that she was gone.
2296,226-1,And he went.
2297,226-1,and found the slipper.
2298,226-1,that had slipped off her foot.
2299,226-1,"It was very, very small, and it was glass, which was a very unusual, uh, shoe design in this time of uh civilization."
2300,226-1,And he sent out word all over the kingdom.
2301,226-1,that he wanted.
2302,226-1,to meet the person who wore this slipper because she was the woman who should be the princess and someday the queen.
2303,226-1,And he began a search as well.
2304,226-1,and went all over the kingdom.
2305,226-1,and no one had a foot.
2306,226-1,"that would fit in this very small stiletto type glass shoe,."
2307,226-1,as he got.
2308,226-1,"to Cinderella's house, the evil sisters tried."
2309,226-1,to cram their foot in the shoe unsuccessfully.
2310,226-1,Prince looked around.
2311,226-1,He saw her peering out the window.
2312,226-1,He asked her.
2313,226-1,to come outside.
2314,226-1,She slipped on the shoe.
2315,226-1,"He realized that she was Cinderella, the woman."
2316,226-1,that he had met.
2317,226-1,that he loved.
2318,226-1,"She became his princess,."
2319,226-1,and they became married.
2320,226-1,"and lived happily ever after ,."
2321,226-1,while the evil stepsisters were left alone in a deteriorating house with no servants.
2322,02-1,"OK, it's about, um, a young woman who has an evil stepmother and two sort of not nice stepsisters,."
2323,02-1,"and , uh, they make her do all of the housework."
2324,02-1,and basically treat her very poorly.
2325,02-1,"Um, and it's about a prince who is looking for a princess."
2326,02-1,"and I don't remember exactly why he has the ball,."
2327,02-1,but he's having a ball.
2328,02-1,"Um, I think he's looking for a princess, uh, maybe, and the two stepsisters and the stepmother are so excited about the ball."
2329,02-1,"and the stepmother wants the the daughters to meet the prince, and anyway, they're all very excited about it."
2330,02-1,"But Cinderella is not to go to the ball, um."
2331,02-1,"And I'm not sure exactly why she's not,."
2332,02-1,"but she doesn't have the dress, she doesn't have anything to go to go to the ball."
2333,02-1,"Um,."
2334,02-1,and then I seem to recall there was a pumpkin.
2335,02-1,"or somehow, um, uh, uh, somebody comes and a fairy godmother or something and something."
2336,02-1,and gives her.
2337,02-1,A dress.
2338,02-1,and turns a pumpkin into a chariot.
2339,02-1,that she can take to the ball.
2340,02-1,Somehow she gets to the ball because of this uh uh fairy and uh and she's beautiful.
2341,02-1,and has a beautiful dress.
2342,02-1,and the prince sees her.
2343,02-1,And the prince falls in love.
2344,02-1,"and put some uh slippers on her feet, um."
2345,02-1,Something.
2346,02-1,or she brings the slippers.
2347,02-1,I'm not sure.
2348,02-1,if he puts the slippers on.
2349,02-1,or she has the slippers on when she comes to the ball.
2350,02-1,"Anyway, after the, uh, so the prince sort of falls in love with her at the ball because she's so beautiful and um and the,."
2351,02-1,as I recall the stepsisters.
2352,02-1,and stepmother don't really know it's her.
2353,02-1,because she looks so different.
2354,02-1,"And uh by at midnight, so part of the deal is she has to leave before the stroke of midnight or something."
2355,02-1,So when the ball is ending.
2356,02-1,"and she's running away to um get back to her chariot, which is the pumpkin, uh, she loses one of her slippers."
2357,02-1,And the prince picks it up.
2358,02-1,"Um, so she gets back home, loses all of, you know, the, the chariot becomes a pumpkin again."
2359,02-1,"or she looks back, looks like herself again."
2360,02-1,"And it's the next day or two,."
2361,02-1,"and the prince goes around looking for the young woman who who wore this slipper, um,."
2362,02-1,"and he's going all around the countryside looking for it nobody fits, no one's foot fits the slipper except for Cinderella's that 's how he knows that she's the one."
2363,02-1,"Um, and her stepmother and stepsisters are so furious about it."
2364,02-1,"I can't believe it's her, but , um, Cinderella."
2365,02-1,and the Prince live happily ever after.
2366,02-1,I think that 's sort of it.
2367,38-1,OK.
2368,38-1,"Uh, Cinderella was a young girl who lived with her father."
2369,38-1,and Her mother had died.
2370,38-1,and her father remarried a stepmother who had two daughters of her own.
2371,38-1,"While the family was blended together, Cinderella's father died."
2372,38-1,and left her with her stepmother and her two stepsisters.
2373,38-1,"After the father passed away, they treated her very badly."
2374,38-1,and made her wait on them.
2375,38-1,"and do all of the housework and be their maid,."
2376,38-1,"and they called her Cinderella because her name was actually Ella,."
2377,38-1,and she sat among the cinders of the fireplace.
2378,38-1,"Um, meanwhile, um."
2379,38-1,There is a kingdom where they live.
2380,38-1,and the prince of the kingdom needs to find a wife.
2381,38-1,So they have a ball for the entire kingdom.
2382,38-1,To come to all the young ladies to come to the ball.
2383,38-1,so the prince can find a wife.
2384,38-1,The two old stepsisters.
2385,38-1,and the stepmother intend to go to the ball.
2386,38-1,"Uh, Cinderella meanwhile is very busy with the household chores."
2387,38-1,"and wants to also go,."
2388,38-1,but she does not have.
2389,38-1,"Um, any time to get herself ready."
2390,38-1,"But somehow she finds time in between to make herself a dress out of some old, well, there's several versions, but the one I've just seen with my granddaughter, um, the old version of, um, making a, a dress out of one of her mother's old old dresses."
2391,38-1,"so when the day of the ball arrives, the two stepsisters."
2392,38-1,"and the stepmother begin to go to the ball,."
2393,38-1,"and Cinderella comes in her lovely dress,."
2394,38-1,but they won't let her go.
2395,38-1,They tear her dress apart.
2396,38-1,And they take off for the ball.
2397,38-1,"Meanwhile, Cinderella's out in the garden, crying so upset,."
2398,38-1,and a fairy godmother appears to her.
2399,38-1,and says.
2400,38-1,"that she, of course, could go to the ball."
2401,38-1,and she designs for her a beautiful dress with her magic wand.
2402,38-1,and turns a pumpkin into a coach and turns.
2403,38-1,"Her little mice and bird friends who have been with her into footmen and coach drivers,."
2404,38-1,and she arrives.
2405,38-1,and gives her glass slippers to go with her beautiful dress.
2406,38-1,She arrives at the ball.
2407,38-1,and the prince immediately has eyes for no one but her and dances with her all evening.
2408,38-1,And the fairy godmother has told her.
2409,38-1,that she must arrive back home at midnight.
2410,38-1,or everything will turn back to what it once was.
2411,38-1,"Um, she's having such a good time."
2412,38-1,"She doesn't notice the time,."
2413,38-1,"but when the clock strikes midnight, she runs out of the ball."
2414,38-1,"It's a long story, isn't it?"
2415,38-1,"Um,."
2416,38-1,and goes running down the steps of the palace.
2417,38-1,and in the process loses one of the glass slippers.
2418,38-1,that falls off.
2419,38-1,"and she runs home in rags and the pumpkin,."
2420,38-1,and the coaches turned back into pumpkin.
2421,38-1,and the mice become mice again.
2422,38-1,So she goes back home.
2423,38-1,And the stepmother.
2424,38-1,and stepsisters arrive home.
2425,38-1,"and tell of this beautiful mysterious princess will arrive,."
2426,38-1,but nobody knows who she is.
2427,38-1,The prince is determined to find out that who this woman is.
2428,38-1,because he wants to marry her.
2429,38-1,So he sends out his couriers to find the girl who fits the glass slipper.
2430,38-1,that was left on the palace steps.
2431,38-1,so they go throughout the kingdom.
2432,38-1,and try the slipper on every foot.
2433,38-1,"that they can, and it's such a delicate small slipper."
2434,38-1,that it cannot fit anyone.
2435,38-1,"When they get to the Cinderella's home, they um Tried on stepsisters,."
2436,38-1,and one of them forces her foot into it in such a way.
2437,38-1,that it breaks the slipper.
2438,38-1,"So when Cinderella comes out, it cannot be tried on her,."
2439,38-1,but she pulls the other glass slipper out of her pocket and shows.
2440,38-1,that she is indeed that princess.
2441,38-1,so the prince brings her to the castle.
2442,38-1,and marries her.
2443,38-1,"On the spot, um, different versions."
2444,38-1,"One is where she forgives the stepmother and stepsisters,."
2445,38-1,and the other is.
2446,38-1,"that she has nothing to do with them ever again,."
2447,38-1,and she lives happily ever after with a prince.
2448,neural12-1,OK.
2449,neural12-1,"Um, Cinderella's father remarries a woman with two daughters."
2450,neural12-1,So that 's her stepmother.
2451,neural12-1,"The stepmother and the daughters are, um, Mean to Cinderella because she is the, she is the stepdaughter."
2452,neural12-1,"Um, there is, uh, an announcement from the king that this, uh,."
2453,neural12-1,that the prince must marry.
2454,neural12-1,and there will be a ball.
2455,neural12-1,"Um, an invitation comes to the family and all of the girls."
2456,neural12-1,and mother are excited to attend.
2457,neural12-1,"Um, but Cinderella, who is, um, Friendly with the mice and the animals around to help her because she's sad because they're mean to her, um, is not invited."
2458,neural12-1,"or she's not allowed to go, let's say."
2459,neural12-1,"Um, so the evil stepsisters, um, That 's what they call them."
2460,neural12-1,Uh.
2461,neural12-1,Get ready to go to the ball.
2462,neural12-1,and Cinderella remains behind.
2463,neural12-1,"Um,."
2464,neural12-1,but her fairy godmother comes along.
2465,neural12-1,"and , uh, helps her with, in, in the Disney version at least, with the help of mice."
2466,neural12-1,"and things, make her a dress, um,."
2467,neural12-1,"and turn, uh, with magic."
2468,neural12-1,and turn her Pumpkin into a carriage.
2469,neural12-1,and she is sent off to the ball.
2470,neural12-1,"Although it's not in the picture, she's supposed to come back by midnight when all the magic ends."
2471,neural12-1,"Um, she goes to the ball, uh, she gets to dance with the prince."
2472,neural12-1,"Uh, they have a lovely time."
2473,neural12-1,"Uh,."
2474,neural12-1,but she realizes midnight is approaching.
2475,neural12-1,and she runs.
2476,neural12-1,She leaves behind a slipper.
2477,neural12-1,The prince finds it.
2478,neural12-1,"Um,."
2479,neural12-1,and goes then after.
2480,neural12-1,"that searching for the girl whose glass slipper it is, um, it."
2481,neural12-1,I discovered.
2482,neural12-1,"that it fits Cinderella, even."
2483,neural12-1,though the evil stepsisters try it on.
2484,neural12-1,Um.
2485,neural12-1,"And it's a terrible thing in the original, they cut their own feet, their own toes off to make the shoe fit."
2486,neural12-1,"Anyway, um, the shoe fits her, and Cinderella."
2487,neural12-1,and the prince get married.
2488,neural12-1,"and live happily ever after, supposedly."
2489,neural7-1,OK.
2490,neural7-1,"Uh, so the slides begin with the introduction of, uh, Cinderella's father to her future, uh,."
2491,neural7-1,or maybe even already married then.
2492,neural7-1,Welcome to your new stepmom and stepsisters.
2493,neural7-1,"Um, They aren't thrilled with her."
2494,neural7-1,"Uh, father dies, that 's not in the slide."
2495,neural7-1,"Um, it, the, the sisters, the stepsisters are mean to her."
2496,neural7-1,"She has to start cleaning, doing all the heavy lifting."
2497,neural7-1,"Uh, in the meantime, she's befriended a bunch of animals."
2498,neural7-1,"and , uh, stares longingly for or at the, uh, the castle where the prince, uh, lives."
2499,neural7-1,"The king is looking for a suitor for his, uh, son to take over, um."
2500,neural7-1,"And uh invitations go out,."
2501,neural7-1,"that 's not depicted either, um."
2502,neural7-1,"Cinderella enacts the, uh,."
2503,neural7-1,or enlists the animals.
2504,neural7-1,"and helping her, uh, create a dress."
2505,neural7-1,"that she can wear, uh, which is successful, but , uh, the relentless cruelty of the stepsisters are such."
2506,neural7-1,"that they, uh, tear the dress."
2507,neural7-1,that make it unwearable.
2508,neural7-1,"Uh, so she's just kind of stuck."
2509,neural7-1,"Um, at which point she uncovers the, uh, The secret, which I think was in the book of uh the fairy godmother who comes."
2510,neural7-1,Gives her uh Horse.
2511,neural7-1,"and carriage, a brand new dress, uh, she goes on to the ball."
2512,neural7-1,She.
2513,neural7-1,and the prince have a really nice time.
2514,neural7-1,She has to leave by midnight.
2515,neural7-1,because everything goes back.
2516,neural7-1,"She leaves her shoe by accident, and even."
2517,neural7-1,"though when everything else uh reverts back to what it was, the shoe for some reason is not, uh, causing the prince to undertake a, uh, kingdom-wide search for the owner of the shoe."
2518,neural7-1,"Uh, she, they make it to Cinderella's house, uh, at which time the stepmom."
2519,neural7-1,"and stepsisters work really hard to sabotage, uh, any attempt to have it fit anybody else's foot,."
2520,neural7-1,but they fail.
2521,neural7-1,It fits on Cinderella's foot.
2522,neural7-1,"They realize it's the same, uh, person, and , uh, She."
2523,neural7-1,"and the prince lived happily ever after, from that point."
2524,209-1,OK.
2525,209-1,"When Cinderella was a young girl, her mother died,."
2526,209-1,and her father um married another woman who also had two young daughters.
2527,209-1,They went to live in the stepwoman's um home.
2528,209-1,"Unfortunately, the stepmother did not care for Cinderella."
2529,209-1,"Over time, the father had passed away, and it was just the stepmother, Cinderella's two stepsisters, and her."
2530,209-1,"Unfortunately, Cinderella lived a very difficult life."
2531,209-1,She became like the maid instead of one of the daughters.
2532,209-1,There was a ball.
2533,209-1,that was going to be held at the castle.
2534,209-1,They went around notifying all of the people who lived in the town about this ball.
2535,209-1,that was going to be um happening.
2536,209-1,The stepmother and the stepsisters were super excited about the possibility.
2537,209-1,of going to the ball.
2538,209-1,and meeting this new prince.
2539,209-1,Cinderella was excited too.
2540,209-1,because she thought she would also have the opportunity to go to the ball.
2541,209-1,The stepsisters got new dresses.
2542,209-1,and were preparing for the ball.
2543,209-1,"Cinderella, though unfortunately did not have a beautiful dress,."
2544,209-1,but she had animal friends that were able to help her.
2545,209-1,There were some little mice who were able to create a beautiful dress out of an older dress.
2546,209-1,"that she had had,."
2547,209-1,and there were some mice who also helped her.
2548,209-1,"On the night of the ball, Cinderella dressed up in her blue dress."
2549,209-1,"and came down the stairs, anxious to go to the ball, only to realize."
2550,209-1,that her stepmother told her.
2551,209-1,that she would not be allowed to go to the ball.
2552,209-1,She tore off her necklace.
2553,209-1,and sent her back upstairs.
2554,209-1,As Cinderella was weeping.
2555,209-1,"and crying, there was a fairy godmother."
2556,209-1,that appeared to her.
2557,209-1,and told her that she would indeed be able to go to the ball.
2558,209-1,"With her magic wand, she created a beautiful dress for Cinderella to wear."
2559,209-1,Not only did she do.
2560,209-1,"that , there was a pumpkin out in the field."
2561,209-1,"With the magic wand, the pumpkin became a coach."
2562,209-1,The mice became horses and footmen.
2563,209-1,Cinderella was able to go to the ball after all.
2564,209-1,The only words her grandmother.
2565,209-1,"or the fairy godmother told her was that when the clock strikes 12, she must be home."
2566,209-1,Cinderella entered the ball in the most beautiful gown ever.
2567,209-1,No one knew who this beautiful girl was.
2568,209-1,As soon.
2569,209-1,"as the prince saw her, he was immediately transfixed."
2570,209-1,Cinderella.
2571,209-1,and the prince danced all through the night.
2572,209-1,"as the clock struck 12, Cinderella remembered her fairy godmother's words."
2573,209-1,"As she was rushing down the stairs, one."
2574,209-1,of her beautiful glass slippers fell off.
2575,209-1,"She continued to run down the stairs, got into the carriage just."
2576,209-1,as the clock was striking 12.
2577,209-1,"The carriage returned to the pumpkin, the horses returned to the mice, and she was back home, being Cinderella again."
2578,209-1,"The prince, astounded."
2579,209-1,"that he could not find this new beautiful girl, and all he had left was the one glass slipper."
2580,209-1,"He was determined to find out who she was, so he sent his aid to all the families around the kingdom to find out who would fit this beautiful glass slipper."
2581,209-1,They came to the castle.
2582,209-1,"that Cinderella was living with, with her two stepsisters."
2583,209-1,In the hand was the glass slipper.
2584,209-1,"Cinderella knew that she was the owner of the glass slipper,."
2585,209-1,but the stepmother did not want her to have any contact with him at all.
2586,209-1,The two stepsisters tried on the glass slipper.
2587,209-1,One's foot was too large.
2588,209-1,and would not fit.
2589,209-1,The other stepsister's foot would not fit in the glass slipper either.
2590,209-1,But at.
2591,209-1,"that moment, Cinderella came down the stairs, and in her hand,."
2592,209-1,"And she came down the stairs,."
2593,209-1,"and she tried on the glass slipper,."
2594,209-1,and it fit beautifully.
2595,209-1,They knew then that she was the mysterious girl that was at the ball.
2596,209-1,Cinderella returned to the palace.
2597,209-1,"and married the prince,."
2598,209-1,and they lived happily ever after.
2599,235-1,"OK, OK, so I can combine the two."
2600,235-1,I can see that 's.
2601,235-1,OK.
2602,235-1,"I don't know what Cinderella's real name was, but she was, um, The beloved daughter of, uh, you know, Husband."
2603,235-1,"and wife, the one her, her mother died,."
2604,235-1,and at some point he met another woman.
2605,235-1,"Who had two daughters,."
2606,235-1,and he brought them home.
2607,235-1,"and married, he married the woman,."
2608,235-1,"and she, he brought the, the second wife."
2609,235-1,and the two daughters to come live with them.
2610,235-1,"And there's Cinderella was sweet of disposition and charming and lovely,."
2611,235-1,"but the new, the stepmother did not like her."
2612,235-1,and turned her into a maid to take care of the needs of her demanding spoiled rotten children.
2613,235-1,And they called her Cinderella.
2614,235-1,"because they, you know, when she wasn't working, cleaning, cooking,."
2615,235-1,"and doing everything for everybody, they took, you know, her place to live was in the kitchen by the fire, and so that was always dirty."
2616,235-1,"and it was, they used um coal to cook with and what was left when you clean the coal out was cinders,."
2617,235-1,but you got very dirty in the process.
2618,235-1,So she was dirty and unkempt.
2619,235-1,And they called her Cinderella because she was always just a little scullery maid in the kitchen.
2620,235-1,"Um, Then one day, you know, the, the, the king of the the The king of the country, yeah, the, the, the king of the country they lived in, had a son who was of marriageable age."
2621,235-1,and who had refused to marry anybody his father had suggested.
2622,235-1,And so his father got fed up and mad.
2623,235-1,"and said, I'm going to have a, a castle, a ball at the castle,."
2624,235-1,"and we're going to invite every eligible young woman in the, in the kingdom,."
2625,235-1,"and by the end of the evening, you must select somebody to marry."
2626,235-1,So all the invitations went out to everybody who had eligible daughters.
2627,235-1,"The wicked stepmother got received the invitation, and she and her two daughters were so ecstatic."
2628,235-1,because they were convinced.
2629,235-1,that one of them would be selected by the prince to get married.
2630,235-1,"So they, they got Cinderella's father to buy them fancy clothes, and they were all giddy and excited,."
2631,235-1,"and at some point, Cinderella said, well, I get to go too,."
2632,235-1,"and they said, oh no, you belong in the kitchen, you don't get to go anywhere."
2633,235-1,And she was heartbroken.
2634,235-1,"In the meantime, she had, you know, befriended because she was a sweet disposition."
2635,235-1,"and loving nature, had all the animals loved her."
2636,235-1,"and went, you know, helped her out."
2637,235-1,and made her life easier.
2638,235-1,because she would sing.
2639,235-1,and they would sing and everybody was happy.
2640,235-1,So the mice decided all got together.
2641,235-1,and Sewed her a beautiful dress.
2642,235-1,"and surprised her at the ball, you know, the night of the ball."
2643,235-1,"and said, Here, here's your beautiful dress."
2644,235-1,You get to go to the ball.
2645,235-1,And she put it on.
2646,235-1,"and she looked sweet and charming and lovely,."
2647,235-1,and the two sisters saw it.
2648,235-1,and just went crazy.
2649,235-1,and tore the dress up.
2650,235-1,and abused her.
2651,235-1,and screamed at her.
2652,235-1,"and sent her back to the kitchen where she was sad and crying,."
2653,235-1,and then they all went off to the ball.
2654,235-1,"And then all of a sudden, The fairy godmother shows up in her Pumped your carriage."
2655,235-1,"No, she didn't have a carriage."
2656,235-1,"No, the fairy godmother shows up."
2657,235-1,"and said, hey, I'm your fairy godmother."
2658,235-1,I'm gonna help you out here.
2659,235-1,And she gave her a beautiful dress and glass slippers.
2660,235-1,"and turned a pumpkin into a coach and the mice and the rat into footman and driver,."
2661,235-1,and they drove her to the palace.
2662,235-1,"She walked in, the prince saw her, fell in love that 's what they do in fairy tales."
2663,235-1,They take one look and they're in love.
2664,235-1,"And they dance all evening,."
2665,235-1,"and he's totally smitten with her,."
2666,235-1,"and he's getting ready to propose when the clock strikes 12 and the one thing the fairy godmother said is at 12, you will turn back into rags and cinders."
2667,235-1,"and you will have, you know, your coach will be gone."
2668,235-1,"and everything will, will disappear."
2669,235-1,So you must be out of there by midnight.
2670,235-1,"Well, they hit 12."
2671,235-1,and she's running down the steps.
2672,235-1,"and one of her glass slippers falls off,."
2673,235-1,and she gets to the coach.
2674,235-1,and they run away.
2675,235-1,"and I guess somewhere on the way home, it all disappears."
2676,235-1,and so she probably has to walk home the rest of the way.
2677,235-1,"In the meantime, the prince picks up the glass slipper, announces to his father, he's found the woman he will marry,."
2678,235-1,"but he will not, you know, and here is her slipper,."
2679,235-1,and he will not marry anybody who does not fit this slipper.
2680,235-1,And this is how he's going to find her.
2681,235-1,So then there's the big Krah throughout the kingdom.
2682,235-1,"as the prince, you know, comes around to all the eligible households who all the households who contain eligible women,."
2683,235-1,and they all try on the slipper.
2684,235-1,"because Cinderella's feet were so small and dainty, which was in those days, a hallmark of a beautiful woman."
2685,235-1,I don't know where.
2686,235-1,"that came from,."
2687,235-1,"that women had to have tiny dainty feet,."
2688,235-1,"but this is, you know, that is the unfortunate."
2689,235-1,"Um, I guess we could call a construct of the 50s or whenever this thing was written,."
2690,235-1,"but Women, you know, elegant women were supposed to have tiny dainty feet."
2691,235-1,"It probably came from the Chinese, that 's where."
2692,235-1,that probably started.
2693,235-1,And So they're trying on the slippers.
2694,235-1,"and in the gruesome the original Grimm's fairy tale, they had women cutting off chunks of their feet to fit in the slipper, you know, like a chunk, one of them cut off a chunk of her heel, another one cut off her big toe."
2695,235-1,"because it was a glass slipper, the prince could see the blood in it."
2696,235-1,"and go, ah yeah, that doesn't really fit."
2697,235-1,So I guess he must have rinsed the slipper out.
2698,235-1,and went on to the next one.
2699,235-1,"And then Somebody said, well, what about Cinderella?"
2700,235-1,"And I don't know who that was,."
2701,235-1,"but he said, yes, everybody must try on the slipper."
2702,235-1,"So she was brought up dirty feet and all, and lo and behold, slipper fit."
2703,235-1,"So, the end of the story is, he he's found Cinderella,."
2704,235-1,"and then they're going to live happily ever after,."
2705,235-1,and they're gonna get married.
2706,235-1,Dumbest story on earth.
2707,235-1,Thank you very much for.
2708,235-1,that My women's studies classes would have had a heyday with.
2709,97-1,"Once upon a time, a nice man who was a, a widower, er, he, his wife had died."
2710,97-1,And he decided he would marry another lady.
2711,97-1,She came to the house with her two daughters.
2712,97-1,Who looked very snooty.
2713,97-1,He introduced his daughter.
2714,97-1,Whose name was Alice.
2715,97-1,And the snooty sisters just were very disdainful of of her.
2716,97-1,"After a while, the new, the new mother decided."
2717,97-1,that Hours Had to work In the house.
2718,97-1,She was supposed she needed to be the housekeeper.
2719,97-1,And one of the things she had to do was to clean out the fireplace.
2720,97-1,She got cinders all over herself.
2721,97-1,The smoothie sisters laughed.
2722,97-1,"You're, we're gonna call you Cinderella."
2723,97-1,"So , That was her name from then on."
2724,97-1,"Well, there was a lot of anxiety going on at the palace."
2725,97-1,Cinderella could see the palace out the window.
2726,97-1,The prime minister and the other guy who I carried me some.
2727,97-1,Executive.
2728,97-1,"Um, the prime minister told the prince, it's time you got married."
2729,97-1,"So , we're gonna plan a wonderful ball."
2730,97-1,"and invite all the young women in the, in the nation to come to the ball."
2731,97-1,Pretty soon.
2732,97-1,The invitation arrived.
2733,97-1,"The snotty sisters, we're thrilled to death."
2734,97-1,We're gonna see the place.
2735,97-1,Maybe he'll choose one of us to be his bride.
2736,97-1,Cinderella was totally left out of everything.
2737,97-1,And It was only by fate.
2738,97-1,that she saw the invitation.
2739,97-1,"And thought, oh, I would love to go to the pool."
2740,97-1,It would be so nice to get out of the house.
2741,97-1,"and dance,."
2742,97-1,and do all those fun things.
2743,97-1,that people do appalled.
2744,97-1,But I don't have any clothes to wear.
2745,97-1,"I don't have I'm, I live in the attic, and I, and ,."
2746,97-1,"and I never get to have any fun, and Her little, her little mouse friends."
2747,97-1,came.
2748,97-1,and told her.
2749,97-1,that they would help her figure out a dress.
2750,97-1,"So ,."
2751,97-1,and they danced around.
2752,97-1,and looked at her.
2753,97-1,"and had ribbons to Put in her hair and , and all kinds of stuff and Oh God, um."
2754,97-1,"So then the snotty sisters left to go to the ball,."
2755,97-1,"and the mother went along, thank heavens."
2756,97-1,The next thing.
2757,97-1,that happened was A fairy godmother came.
2758,97-1,"She said, Cinderella, I have been watching you,."
2759,97-1,"and you know, You work so hard,."
2760,97-1,and these people treat you so cruelly.
2761,97-1,I'm gonna do some magic for you.
2762,97-1,that you can go to the ball.
2763,97-1,"Cinderella was thrilled,."
2764,97-1,"and the fairy godmother went blink with her magic wand,."
2765,97-1,and Cinderella had a beautiful dress.
2766,97-1,And Glass slippers.
2767,97-1,"But how am I going to get to the ball, Cinderella said."
2768,97-1,"There I godmother said, never fear, my dear."
2769,97-1,"We have a coach right here for you, blink,."
2770,97-1,and a pumpkin turned into a gorgeous coach with Beautiful horses to pull it.
2771,97-1,"Now, the fairy godmother said, there's only one thing."
2772,97-1,This magic only lasts till midnight.
2773,97-1,So you must make sure you leave the ball before midnight.
2774,97-1,Because everything will come back to the way it was at midnight.
2775,97-1,"Oh, fairy godmother, I promise, I promise."
2776,97-1,So off she went to the ball.
2777,97-1,And here's the ballroom.
2778,97-1,It's beautiful.
2779,97-1,It's all decorated with gold.
2780,97-1,and What's happening?
2781,97-1,The snatty sisters are furious.
2782,97-1,The prince is dancing with Cinderella.
2783,97-1,"He seems to like her a lot,."
2784,97-1,"and she looks very, very happy."
2785,97-1,Bobo.
2786,97-1,Uh oh.
2787,97-1,The clock is striking midnight.
2788,97-1,"Oh, Cinderella."
2789,97-1,"00 my goodness, we have to leave."
2790,97-1,I have to leave right now.
2791,97-1,"But ,."
2792,97-1,"but the prince says, no, I, I'm sorry,."
2793,97-1,but I have to go right away.
2794,97-1,And she ran down the stairs.
2795,97-1,and lost one of her slippers.
2796,97-1,The prime minister saw it.
2797,97-1,and picked it up.
2798,97-1,"and tried to return it to her,."
2799,97-1,but she left.
2800,97-1,And went back home.
2801,97-1,And started doing her chores again.
2802,97-1,"But the Prime Minister had her shoe,."
2803,97-1,and he showed it to the prince and all the other People.
2804,97-1,"And The prince said, we must find her."
2805,97-1,"I've fallen in love,."
2806,97-1,"so They, the, all the palace went out."
2807,97-1,They took the slipper.
2808,97-1,On a gorgeous pillow.
2809,97-1,"They had enshrined it,."
2810,97-1,"and they, they went around to every house where every young woman lived."
2811,97-1,And they finally came to the house where Cinderella who lived with the snotty sisters.
2812,97-1,"Well, I'm sure it's gonna fit my foot, said sister #1,."
2813,97-1,"and she struggled,."
2814,97-1,and she struggled.
2815,97-1,"and she struggled,."
2816,97-1,but she couldn't even get her big toe in it.
2817,97-1,"And then the other, the next sister, sister #2, said, oh, it'll fit me, I'm sure."
2818,97-1,"But , um, uh, no, it's too tight."
2819,97-1,It's horrible.
2820,97-1,I am I can't wear it.
2821,97-1,Cinderella was standing over the side of the room watching.
2822,97-1,And the prime minister or the servant or whoever it was?
2823,97-1,that had The glass slipper on the pillow looked at her?
2824,97-1,"and said, Miss, would you like to try it?"
2825,97-1,"And she said, oh, Uh, I don't, I, well, I, oh, you woman, you'll never hit."
2826,97-1,"that thing, said the sisters."
2827,97-1,"She says, well, I guess I'll try it."
2828,97-1,So she put her dainty little foot.
2829,97-1,"Into the shoe,."
2830,97-1,and it fit.
2831,97-1,"Perfectly, of course, because it was her slipper."
2832,97-1,It didn't turn back for some reason after a while.
2833,97-1,"Um Hooray, everybody's happy."
2834,97-1,"The princess found his Cinderella, and they're in love,."
2835,97-1,and they lived happily ever after.
2836,218-1,"Well, Cinderella is the name of a girl who lives with her father, um,."
2837,218-1,"and he is widowed,."
2838,218-1,"and she is, does not have a mother."
2839,218-1,And one day he comes home.
2840,218-1,and announces.
2841,218-1,that he's remarried.
2842,218-1,"Cinderella's probably about , um, mid teenage to late teenage years, and she's very surprised at this news."
2843,218-1,that her father is getting married.
2844,218-1,"And in fact, he brings home the woman he's married, um."
2845,218-1,Announces that she is now Cinderella's stepmother.
2846,218-1,"and the stepmother has two of her own daughters,."
2847,218-1,so Cinderella suddenly has a stepmother and two stepsisters.
2848,218-1,"Cinderella is a very sweethearted, goodhearted person."
2849,218-1,and is gonna take this as well.
2850,218-1,as she can.
2851,218-1,"The problem is the the stepmother becomes in literature what we call the prototype of the evil stepmother, and she's really horrible to Cinderella."
2852,218-1,and treats her as um her servant.
2853,218-1,and forces her to do a lot of chores.
2854,218-1,The stepsisters are equally mean to Cinderella.
2855,218-1,"and make fun of her a lot,."
2856,218-1,and they have a lot of advantages.
2857,218-1,"that Cinderella doesn't have, and all of a sudden Cinderella's life is very miserable."
2858,218-1,"What was OK before the arrival of this group with her father,."
2859,218-1,"albeit she didn't have a mother, she's um suddenly being treated horribly,."
2860,218-1,and she's um actually called Cinderella.
2861,218-1,because she spends a lot of time.
2862,218-1,"I, I, she's at least sweeping up ashes in the in the fireplace, uh,."
2863,218-1,"that is cinders, um, she might even be kind of living near it."
2864,218-1,"or sleeping near it, that 's how she comes about this nickname in the story."
2865,218-1,We never know her actual story.
2866,218-1,"So life is pretty miserable and of course this is in the kingdom,."
2867,218-1,so they're living in a little house and the larger context is in a in a kingdom.
2868,218-1,"And one day, um, There's of course a prince in the kingdom, and his advisors and perhaps his dad are worried."
2869,218-1,that he's not getting married.
2870,218-1,So they decide to have a ball where he can be introduced to all the elderible young women in the in the community.
2871,218-1,so they issued an invitation to every household in the the village who has an eligible young woman of the the proper age range as the prince.
2872,218-1,So this um invitation arrives.
2873,218-1,and the stepmother Cinderella's stepmother opens it and is very excited.
2874,218-1,"because her daughters would fall under that eligibility, um."
2875,218-1,"And we'll be in, we'll go to the ball."
2876,218-1,"and Cinderella somehow gives the impression she also thinks she is invited by virtue of this invitation,."
2877,218-1,but then she's informed rather rudely by her stepmother and laughing stepsisters.
2878,218-1,that there's no way she's going to be good at this.
2879,218-1,She's just too pathetic.
2880,218-1,She's not going to go.
2881,218-1,"So they, the stepmother bustles."
2882,218-1,around getting the step sisters ready for the.
2883,218-1,For the ball.
2884,218-1,"and They're going to leave Cinderella at home, um,."
2885,218-1,"and she, she, they do and she's very sad,."
2886,218-1,"but Cinderella has a lot of little friends, uh, mostly in the form of little creatures in her home, i."
2887,218-1,e.
2888,218-1,"mice,."
2889,218-1,"and I can't remember, maybe there's a rabbit in there."
2890,218-1,"and what emerges,."
2891,218-1,and I can't remember how this happens is a fairy godmother.
2892,218-1,"Cinderella very much wants to go to this ball,."
2893,218-1,so the fairy godmother pings her with a magic wand.
2894,218-1,and all of a sudden a very ordinary dress she has on turns into a really beautiful dress.
2895,218-1,and her hair is all done up.
2896,218-1,"and most miraculous of all, she's wearing a pair of golden slip of glass slippers."
2897,218-1,And um she takes her outside.
2898,218-1,and a group of mice are transformed into the um.
2899,218-1,Drivers of a coach.
2900,218-1,that is converted into a lovely coach out of a pumpkin.
2901,218-1,"so here's Cinderella, she has the dress, she has the glass slippers,."
2902,218-1,and she has a coach.
2903,218-1,"and she's going to be able to go to this ball, but the warning."
2904,218-1,that the um Godmother gives her is.
2905,218-1,that she has to be home by the stroke of midnight.
2906,218-1,or she's gonna turn back into her normal self.
2907,218-1,The coach will turn back into a pumpkin.
2908,218-1,So she's gotta be home by then.
2909,218-1,or all this goes back to the way it is.
2910,218-1,So Cinderella proceeds to the ball.
2911,218-1,"and um she enters and of course her stepsisters are already there,."
2912,218-1,but they're not exactly making a great impression.
2913,218-1,"because to be perfectly honest, they're pretty hideous looking and um."
2914,218-1,"But the minute she walks in, um, the prince sees Cinderella."
2915,218-1,"and is taken by her,."
2916,218-1,"and they dance the night away,."
2917,218-1,"and of course he's never seen her before, he's never heard of her."
2918,218-1,"and how she manages to get this guy convinced of who she is is kind of amazing,."
2919,218-1,That 's OK.
2920,218-1,And uh.
2921,218-1,"so they dance the night away,."
2922,218-1,"and then all of a sudden she hears the clock striking midnight, 123 times,."
2923,218-1,and she knows she's got to get home.
2924,218-1,because she's gonna be transformed back into this.
2925,218-1,"Woman who hangs out by the fireplace at home in her tatters and apron, etc."
2926,218-1,"So in her rush to get out of there, she leaves behind one of her glass slippers."
2927,218-1,and runs home and then sure enough she makes it home just in time.
2928,218-1,But she realizes she's lost one of the slippers.
2929,218-1,"Well, she goes back to her normal life, horrible life,."
2930,218-1,"and the um stepsisters are talking on and on about how wonderful the ball was,."
2931,218-1,but there was a mysterious girl.
2932,218-1,"that they didn't know who she was, who was occupying all the prince's time, and they're very jealous."
2933,218-1,And the prince has found this glass slipper on the stairway of the castle.
2934,218-1,"and tells his Retinue, he had, they have to find out who this girl was because he's in love with her."
2935,218-1,and he wants to know who she is.
2936,218-1,"So they embark on a house by house search with this glass slipper to find out who it belongs to in the village,."
2937,218-1,"and they try on, they make the eligible women in the household, every one of them try on this glass slipper."
2938,218-1,"And um they come to Cinderella's house, of course, the really horrible version, true version of this in the actual fairy tale is."
2939,218-1,that One of the sisters cuts off her top of her foot.
2940,218-1,"so she will fit into this class of her, but anyway."
2941,218-1,"Um, they tried it on, of course it doesn't fit,."
2942,218-1,and it fits on Cinderella's foot.
2943,218-1,And of course her sister step sisters are shocked.
2944,218-1,The stepmother is shocked.
2945,218-1,"and yet it's, it's hurts, it's Cinderella,."
2946,218-1,and the prince appears and he.
2947,218-1,"and Cinderella are reunited,."
2948,218-1,"and they marry,."
2949,218-1,and she moves into the castle.
2950,218-1,"and becomes a princess,."
2951,218-1,and they live.
2952,neural11-1,OK.
2953,neural11-1,"So when Cinderella was a little girl, her mom passed away,."
2954,neural11-1,"and her father remarried another woman who had two daughters, but they were not very kind to Cinderella."
2955,neural11-1,"The daughters, her stepsisters were very mean to her, as was the stepmother."
2956,neural11-1,"as they grew up, they asked Cinderella to do all the chores around the house,."
2957,neural11-1,and she didn't get to participate in the same things.
2958,neural11-1,that her stepsisters did.
2959,neural11-1,"So , one day, they received an invitation from the palace."
2960,neural11-1,that said the prince was having a ball.
2961,neural11-1,and wanted to invite all of the single women throughout the land to come to the ball.
2962,neural11-1,because he was looking for a princess.
2963,neural11-1,"And the stepsisters were very excited about it, so was Cinderella."
2964,neural11-1,But the stepmother.
2965,neural11-1,"and stepsister said, oh well, you can't go to the ball."
2966,neural11-1,because you have nothing to wear.
2967,neural11-1,so Cinderella found a trunk in the attic.
2968,neural11-1,and made a dress herself with her animal friends.
2969,neural11-1,that she had made through the years.
2970,neural11-1,"And it was a beautiful dress,."
2971,neural11-1,and she was so excited because now she'd be able to go to the ball.
2972,neural11-1,"And when her stepsister saw it, they tore it apart."
2973,neural11-1,because they were so angry that she was able to put something like that together.
2974,neural11-1,So Cinderella was distraught.
2975,neural11-1,and went to her room.
2976,neural11-1,"and cried,."
2977,neural11-1,"and the stepsisters went off to the ball,."
2978,neural11-1,and along came Cinderella's fairy godmother.
2979,neural11-1,"And she said, oh well, you can go to the ball."
2980,neural11-1,"And she turned the pumpkin into a carriage, and the dogs into horses, and the mice into the porters,."
2981,neural11-1,and Cinderella went into the carriage.
2982,neural11-1,and went on to the ball.
2983,neural11-1,She danced with the prince.
2984,neural11-1,"and had a wonderful time,."
2985,neural11-1,but remember.
2986,neural11-1,that her fairy godmother told her.
2987,neural11-1,that she must leave by midnight.
2988,neural11-1,or everything would go back to the way they were.
2989,neural11-1,"So she So sorry, that was my dog."
2990,neural11-1,"So she noticed that it was about to strike midnight,."
2991,neural11-1,and she tore away from the prince.
2992,neural11-1,and ran away.
2993,neural11-1,and got home just in time.
2994,neural11-1,before everything turned back to what they were.
2995,neural11-1,But she realized.
2996,neural11-1,that she had dropped her uh slipper on the stairs.
2997,neural11-1,"And , and ,."
2998,neural11-1,"but the other slippers stayed the same,."
2999,neural11-1,so she kept it.
3000,neural11-1,because she had wonderful memories from the ball.
3001,neural11-1,And later.
3002,neural11-1,"that week, the prince wanted to find the beautiful woman who he had danced with throughout the evening,."
3003,neural11-1,and he took the glass slipper.
3004,neural11-1,that he found on the stairs.
3005,neural11-1,and went around to every single woman in the village to see.
3006,neural11-1,if he could find who it belonged to.
3007,neural11-1,So the stepmother locked Cinderella in her attic room.
3008,neural11-1,because she had a feeling that was her.
3009,neural11-1,And The prince came to their house.
3010,neural11-1,"and tried the slipper on the stepsisters,."
3011,neural11-1,but it didn't fit them.
3012,neural11-1,"And Cinderella's animal friends slipped her a key under the crack of the door, and she was able to get out."
3013,neural11-1,and came down just in time that the prince was able to see her.
3014,neural11-1,And he tried the glass slipper on Cinderella.
3015,neural11-1,"and it fit,."
3016,neural11-1,and he realized that she was the woman.
3017,neural11-1,"that he had danced with,."
3018,neural11-1,and then they got married.
3019,neural11-1,and lived happily ever after.
3020,capilouto06a,"OK, Cinderella's father is a widower."
3021,capilouto06a,And he's getting ready to marry a woman.
3022,capilouto06a,"Who will be Cinderella's stepmother,."
3023,capilouto06a,"and she already has two daughters,."
3024,capilouto06a,so he introduces them.
3025,capilouto06a,and Stepmother looks at Cinderella like She was a bad dream or something.
3026,capilouto06a,"At any rate, you could tell from her face."
3027,capilouto06a,"that she wasn't going to be a very kind stepmother,."
3028,capilouto06a,"so right away, she put Cinderella to work waiting on everybody."
3029,capilouto06a,and doing everything.
3030,capilouto06a,In the book.
3031,capilouto06a,"that I knew when I was a child, she cleaned out cinders from the fireplace,."
3032,capilouto06a,but they don't do that anymore.
3033,capilouto06a,But uh she waited on everybody.
3034,capilouto06a,She was a servant and the girls were top drawer in the house.
3035,capilouto06a,and um There is a picture in that book.
3036,capilouto06a,that looks if maybe it's the king ranting.
3037,capilouto06a,and raving.
3038,capilouto06a,"because his son needs to have a wife,."
3039,capilouto06a,"so they have a ball,."
3040,capilouto06a,"and the general idea is to introduce the prince to the eligible young ladies,."
3041,capilouto06a,and the two stepdaughters get all dressed up.
3042,capilouto06a,and get ready to go.
3043,capilouto06a,Cinderella is not going to be allowed to go.
3044,capilouto06a,And um.
3045,capilouto06a,"While everything is going on, the ball."
3046,capilouto06a,"and everything, there's a little."
3047,capilouto06a,Cute little plump lady who turns out to be the fairy godmother.
3048,capilouto06a,"Um, comes and ,."
3049,capilouto06a,"and tells, uh, Cinderella."
3050,capilouto06a,that they're to go up in the attic.
3051,capilouto06a,and she will find a dress.
3052,capilouto06a,That she can wear.
3053,capilouto06a,and go to the ball.
3054,capilouto06a,"So Cinderella goes up in the attic, she gets the dress."
3055,capilouto06a,"This fairy godmother makes a Coach out of a pumpkin,."
3056,capilouto06a,"and she makes horses out of mice,."
3057,capilouto06a,and off Cinderella goes to the ball.
3058,capilouto06a,"The prince, who is very handsome, sees her, falls in love with her."
3059,capilouto06a,"And he had um She's supposed to be home by midnight, no matter what."
3060,capilouto06a,The fairy godmother tells her she must be home by midnight.
3061,capilouto06a,"So when it gets close to midnight, she rushes,."
3062,capilouto06a,"as she rushes down the steps, she, one of her glass slippers falls off."
3063,capilouto06a,"And um the um I don't know what you'd call him, equerry, I guess he is, um, brings the shoe."
3064,capilouto06a,and gives it to the prince.
3065,capilouto06a,"The prince sends out a little fat man with a pillow all over to try on this shoe,."
3066,capilouto06a,"and the stepmother is sitting there thinking for sure her daughters are going to be, are going to fit the slipper,."
3067,capilouto06a,"but they don't,."
3068,capilouto06a,"and Suddenly, the guy says, well, we haven't tried Cinderella yet, this young lady,."
3069,capilouto06a,and the stepmother looks horrified.
3070,capilouto06a,"that Cinderella would even be considered,."
3071,capilouto06a,but they tried to slipper on her foot.
3072,capilouto06a,"and it fits perfectly, that 's the one."
3073,capilouto06a,"that the prince is looking for,."
3074,capilouto06a,so she goes.
3075,capilouto06a,and uh they live happily ever after.
3076,capilouto10a,"Cinderella was evidently a, Servant."
3077,capilouto10a,To this uppity family which had a couple of daughters.
3078,capilouto10a,And the daughters were invited to a big banquet or ball.
3079,capilouto10a,"And Cinderella was shocked because , not shocked,."
3080,capilouto10a,but she knew she was not of the same level.
3081,capilouto10a,"So, social level, so she didn't get to go."
3082,capilouto10a,So then.
3083,capilouto10a,after they had left.
3084,capilouto10a,She was dreaming.
3085,capilouto10a,"OK,."
3086,capilouto10a,"and in her dreams, Somehow she got a nice dress."
3087,capilouto10a,"and , uh, A, uh, Team came by to get her, a team of horses with a pumpkin."
3088,capilouto10a,Was what the carriage looked like.
3089,capilouto10a,So she went to the ball.
3090,capilouto10a,"And she got the ball and everybody was excited cause she was there, nervous for something they didn't want her, the daughters or sisters."
3091,capilouto10a,"or whatever they were, um, they didn't want her there."
3092,capilouto10a,So she meets the prince.
3093,capilouto10a,And her.
3094,capilouto10a,and the prince were dancing.
3095,capilouto10a,and she's all dressed up in a nice dress.
3096,capilouto10a,And then the clock strikes 12.
3097,capilouto10a,But she was told.
3098,capilouto10a,"that she had to get back away from the ball by this ferry, good ferry, and , uh, at 12 o'clock."
3099,capilouto10a,"So, she rushes out of there."
3100,capilouto10a,and she goes home.
3101,capilouto10a,She gets in the carriage.
3102,capilouto10a,"and the carriage is already, Disintegrated."
3103,capilouto10a,She was sitting on a little pumpkin.
3104,capilouto10a,"Ultimately, she gets home, back to wherever she was working."
3105,capilouto10a,"I, I'm assuming that she was a, uh, Some kind of a maid or something."
3106,capilouto10a,"Anyway, then the, it appears as a princess."
3107,capilouto10a,Father.
3108,capilouto10a,or his servant came over with a slipper.
3109,capilouto10a,And uh he was searching for whoever the slipper would fit.
3110,capilouto10a,"And they tried the other sisters or maid or not, or other people."
3111,capilouto10a,that lived in the house.
3112,capilouto10a,"I'm, I forget now whether it was her sisters whether he was just a, uh, or she was just a maid for them."
3113,capilouto10a,And she tried all of them.
3114,capilouto10a,and it didn't work.
3115,capilouto10a,So then finally he looked at Cinderella.
3116,capilouto10a,and tried it on Cinderella.
3117,capilouto10a,"And it fit her foot, so then the, whoever the servant was, he rushed her off."
3118,capilouto10a,"She ran to the prince, she got all dressed up again,."
3119,capilouto10a,and they got married.
3120,capilouto10a,and lived happily ever.
3121,224-1,"So Cinderella, uh, was apparently for some reason, I don't recall the reason was, uh, uh, taken in."
3122,224-1,"by uh this woman who had two daughters, um, I guess they were, she was a stepdaughter."
3123,224-1,"I'm not sure how that's really in, in my own remembrance, don't recall that part of the story, because I'm not that fond of the story."
3124,224-1,"But ,."
3125,224-1,but Cinderella was introduced into this household where there were two sisters.
3126,224-1,and um She was seen.
3127,224-1,"as , she was treated as a scullery maid."
3128,224-1,and um they've disdained her greatly and um And so.
3129,224-1,"as it turns out, uh, Cinderella was of course, beloved by all those around her because she's a kind and gentle person,."
3130,224-1,but the skin the stepsister treated her very badly.
3131,224-1,"Uh, the, um,."
3132,224-1,"of course the animals, uh, she befriended the animals,."
3133,224-1,"as it turns out, there was a prince in the uh kingdom there."
3134,224-1,and the prince was going to have a ball and um.
3135,224-1,of course the stepsisters were wanting to go to the ball.
3136,224-1,and be chosen by the prince to be his bride and uh.
3137,224-1,of course they got the invitation to go.
3138,224-1,and uh Cinderella wanted to go as well.
3139,224-1,"and so she um She, I don't know how exactly she got invited, but so,."
3140,224-1,or maybe she just chose to go.
3141,224-1,"She went to the, um, she went to the ball."
3142,224-1,"of course, was discovered by the stepsisters."
3143,224-1,and they made her run away.
3144,224-1,"and um actually she got there, I believe,."
3145,224-1,"by going with the fairy godmother who made her a um Uh, what do you call it, a, a carriage,."
3146,224-1,and the carriage took her from that uh house of the stepmother to the ball and um.
3147,224-1,"Again, she arrived."
3148,224-1,"and she was um found out by the stepsisters who did, who outed her."
3149,224-1,and um made her leave.
3150,224-1,"and in her leaving, um she, well, actually during the time."
3151,224-1,"of being at the ball, she met the prince."
3152,224-1,"and uh he didn't know much anything about her,."
3153,224-1,but they obviously have great connection.
3154,224-1,And then when she left.
3155,224-1,because she was discovered.
3156,224-1,"as not necessarily being invited, um, she ran away."
3157,224-1,"and she left one of her slippers there at the uh palace,."
3158,224-1,"and so, um, The prince found the slipper."
3159,224-1,and recognized this is from the woman that he met.
3160,224-1,"and he wanted to meet her again,."
3161,224-1,and so he sent out a decree that uh he wanted to match any person that fit this shoe.
3162,224-1,"of course, the stepsister tried that didn't work for them,."
3163,224-1,but then it turns out.
3164,neural43-1,OK.
3165,neural43-1,"So, Cinderella."
3166,neural43-1,was an only child.
3167,neural43-1,"And she, I, I guess her father, uh, got remarried to a woman who became her stepmother,?"
3168,neural43-1,"and this woman had two daughters of her own,?"
3169,neural43-1,and they quickly moved into Cinderella's house?
3170,neural43-1,"and overtook the house,?"
3171,neural43-1,"and I do forget what happened to the dad,?"
3172,neural43-1,"but he went off and it was just Cinderella, the two stepsisters and the stepmother, and The stepmother?"
3173,neural43-1,"and the stepsisters use Cinderella as a maid,?"
3174,neural43-1,"and they renamed her to Cinderella because of cinders and all the cleaning, and she was dirty,?"
3175,neural43-1,"and they told her how she wasn't pretty, and she was really truly much prettier than her mean evil stepsisters,?"
3176,neural43-1,and um the What would you call it?
3177,neural43-1,"The town, the region decides the prince is going to have a ball,."
3178,neural43-1,"and the two sisters come home and their mom, and they're very excited."
3179,neural43-1,"because there's going to be a ball,."
3180,neural43-1,"and all the young women of the lands are invited,."
3181,neural43-1,"and the, um, two sisters start planning their outfits,."
3182,neural43-1,"and the mother's involved in It,."
3183,neural43-1,and all assuming.
3184,neural43-1,"that Cinderella would never even go because she's ugly and dirty,."
3185,neural43-1,"and , uh, the prince would never want to see her."
3186,neural43-1,"So, the night comes."
3187,neural43-1,and the two sisters get themselves all beautiful.
3188,neural43-1,"Uh,."
3189,neural43-1,and off they go to the ball.
3190,neural43-1,And I think the mother may have gone as well.
3191,neural43-1,And She's left at home.
3192,neural43-1,and she's sitting out in the garden.
3193,neural43-1,and her fairy godmother appears.
3194,neural43-1,and the fairy godmother has a chit chat with her.
3195,neural43-1,and finds out she really does wanna go.
3196,neural43-1,So the fairy godmother um uses her wonderful magic wand.
3197,neural43-1,"and then uses the help of the tiny little mice, and the mice."
3198,neural43-1,"or poof become the um I don't know what you call it, the uh chariot attendants, so the the Fairy godmother gets her all beautiful in a dress, her hair is all done up."
3199,neural43-1,She's absolutely exquisite.
3200,neural43-1,"She takes a pumpkin, ba ba ba boom."
3201,neural43-1,The pumpkin becomes the beautiful chariot.
3202,neural43-1,The mice become the chariot people.
3203,neural43-1,"They open the doors, they drive her off to the ball."
3204,neural43-1,She has a lovely night.
3205,neural43-1,"Oh, almost forgot."
3206,neural43-1,"As she gets into the pumpkin chariot, which is now beautiful, the fairy godmother says, have a great time, but you must be home by midnight."
3207,neural43-1,"cause all this is going to disappear, the magic at midnight."
3208,neural43-1,"So she goes off, she goes to the ball,."
3209,neural43-1,"and the prince is dancing with everybody,."
3210,neural43-1,"and of course he sees Cinderella, who is by far the most beautiful in the room."
3211,neural43-1,He asks her to dance.
3212,neural43-1,"They have many lovely dances,."
3213,neural43-1,"and then all of a sudden she tunes in what time it is somehow,."
3214,neural43-1,"and she says, I must leave."
3215,neural43-1,"He says, no, no, no,."
3216,neural43-1,"and she's like, no, I really must go."
3217,neural43-1,She starts to run off because it's almost about to strike midnight.
3218,neural43-1,She's running down the steps of the palace.
3219,neural43-1,"She just gets into her, um, Pumpkin chariot."
3220,neural43-1,"She leaves,."
3221,neural43-1,"as she's running, she leaves a sandal step, uh, what you call it, a beautiful pump on the steps."
3222,neural43-1,"She,."
3223,neural43-1,"as she goes, the chariot turns back into a pumpkin."
3224,neural43-1,She manages to get home in time before the stepsisters.
3225,neural43-1,And they come home.
3226,neural43-1,and say what a wonderful time.
3227,neural43-1,They kind of tease her.
3228,neural43-1,"for being stuck at home, um,."
3229,neural43-1,"and ask her what she did,."
3230,neural43-1,and they dream about what a wonderful time.
3231,neural43-1,"and then it, everybody learns the following morning."
3232,neural43-1,"that Whoever the prince was dancing with all night left her slipper behind,."
3233,neural43-1,and he is going throughout the lands to find whose foot fits the slipper.
3234,neural43-1,"And it's a very delicate glass slipper,."
3235,neural43-1,and so eventually they get to Cinderella's home.
3236,neural43-1,The two mean stepsisters try to squish their big foot into it.
3237,neural43-1,"Of course, it doesn't fit."
3238,neural43-1,Cinderella wants to try it.
3239,neural43-1,They think it's ridiculous.
3240,neural43-1,because she wasn't really supposed to be there.
3241,neural43-1,And somehow she sweet talks.
3242,neural43-1,and she gets to try the slipper on.
3243,neural43-1,"or maybe the man, I forget the."
3244,neural43-1,"Prince's helper says, no, let her try, that 's the order."
3245,neural43-1,"And her foot fits and voila, she is the princess, the beautiful woman."
3246,neural43-1,that was dancing with the prince.
3247,neural43-1,The sisters are outraged.
3248,neural43-1,The prince is thrilled.
3249,neural43-1,"He comes, he meets Cinderella."
3250,neural43-1,"He sees, as soon."
3251,neural43-1,as he sees her eyes.
3252,neural43-1,"and face, he knows it's really Cinderella."
3253,neural43-1,"He takes her away, he makes her his wife, they live happily ever after."
3254,93-1,"So , uh, there's a little girl whose mother dies."
3255,93-1,and her father marries a woman with two.
3256,93-1,Two daughters already.
3257,93-1,"The father goes away, dies, we're not exactly sure."
3258,93-1,"Um,."
3259,93-1,"and , uh, Cinderella is left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who turn out to be really mean."
3260,93-1,"Um, let's see,."
3261,93-1,and they would demote her.
3262,93-1,"and relegate her to be a housekeeper, cook, um, somewhat of a kept."
3263,93-1,"Uh, postponed slave."
3264,93-1,And um so the next chapter is.
3265,93-1,that there is a prince who is not married.
3266,93-1,and um His parents have decided that the way.
3267,93-1,for him to find a wife is to have a grand ball.
3268,93-1,"Um, And um."
3269,93-1,so invitations are sent to all the single young women in the land.
3270,93-1,"And the invitations go to the stepsisters, stepmothers and stepsister's house."
3271,93-1,"And of course, uh, the stepsisters."
3272,93-1,"and the stepmothers say to Cinderella, oh, you can't come to the ball, you are not, you don't have the clothes,."
3273,93-1,"and you have too much work to do, etc."
3274,93-1,etc.
3275,93-1,"Um, And Cinderella is very sad."
3276,93-1,"Now, in the Disney version, she talks to animals, etc."
3277,93-1,"Uh, I don't know if in the Grimm's fairy tale or whatever, it's."
3278,93-1,that actually happens.
3279,93-1,"Um,."
3280,93-1,"but her animal friends in, in the Disney version have decided."
3281,93-1,that they're going to do something to help her out.
3282,93-1,"And um, while Cinderella is very glum."
3283,93-1,"about not being able to go to the ball, the animals try to make arrangements,."
3284,93-1,and they bring on a fairy godmother.
3285,93-1,"Who,."
3286,93-1,"if I remember right, takes a pumpkin."
3287,93-1,and makes it into a coach.
3288,93-1,Makes the mice.
3289,93-1,"that are hanging out into footmen and horses,."
3290,93-1,"or maybe another animal becomes the footman,."
3291,93-1,and the mice become the horse.
3292,93-1,"And um she has Cinderella in a gorgeous gown, and on her feet are glass slippers,."
3293,93-1,"as she gets into the coach to go to the ball, She is told that she must be back by midnight absolutely positively."
3294,93-1,So depending on which version of Cinderella you read or etc.
3295,93-1,she goes to the ball.
3296,93-1,"There is, um, she finds herself very attracted to the prince."
3297,93-1,They dance all night.
3298,93-1,"Her sisters see her in this version, or whatever version."
3299,93-1,"There's an opera, Cinderella, I think I saw the opera Cinderella too."
3300,93-1,"Um, Anyways, the weather, the sisters don't really get involved."
3301,93-1,She dances all night with the prince.
3302,93-1,"and she forgets that it's midnight,."
3303,93-1,"but when the clock starts striking midnight, she runs away to the coach."
3304,93-1,"Uh, leaving a glass slipper behind."
3305,93-1,And gets in the coach.
3306,93-1,and barely makes it home.
3307,93-1,"before everything turns to pumpkins and mice, and she's back in her raggedy clothes."
3308,93-1,The next chapter is.
3309,93-1,that the Prince runs after her.
3310,93-1,"She has disappeared,."
3311,93-1,but he finds a glass slipper.
3312,93-1,"And he goes back to the castle, saying I've found the woman."
3313,93-1,"that I want to marry,."
3314,93-1,"but I don't know who she is, and all I have is this glass slipper."
3315,93-1,"It is a little glass slipper,."
3316,93-1,"so the prince goes out with his ambassador, whoever."
3317,93-1,"I don't know what a princes, maybe his valet, I, whoever his second banana is,."
3318,93-1,and he goes to try the slipper on all the eligible women in the kingdom.
3319,93-1,"He comes to the stepmother's house,."
3320,93-1,"and the two stepsisters try on the glass slipper, and it is far too small for their big feet."
3321,93-1,And the prince is.
3322,93-1,"about to go,."
3323,93-1,"if I remember right, the animals kind of forced Cinderella to come to the door,."
3324,93-1,and he tries the Slipper on her foot.
3325,93-1,"and it fits, and they are the prince."
3326,93-1,and Cinderella are reunited.
3327,93-1,and They go off into the sunset happily ever after.
3328,70-1,Summarize it for you.
3329,70-1,"Once upon a time, there's a little girl who whose mother had passed away."
3330,70-1,"and her father gets remarried, um, to this woman who has two daughters."
3331,70-1,"Sadly, the father passes away and the stepmother."
3332,70-1,and her two daughters take advantage of Cinderella.
3333,70-1,and make her do all the chores around the house.
3334,70-1,Then there's this big ball that's gonna happen at the castle.
3335,70-1,"And all the young maidens in the land are invited, and Cinderella is so excited."
3336,70-1,"and she makes her own little dress,."
3337,70-1,but the the two stepsisters often referred to as ugly stepsisters.
3338,70-1,I never liked those words.
3339,70-1,um.
3340,70-1,Don't want her to go.
3341,70-1,And so they tear up her dress.
3342,70-1,"and leave her behind,."
3343,70-1,and they go off to the ball with the stepmother.
3344,70-1,But then the fairy godmother comes along.
3345,70-1,and helps her.
3346,70-1,and makes her this beautiful dress.
3347,70-1,and turns a pumpkin into the carriage.
3348,70-1,and goes off to the ball.
3349,70-1,"and she meets the handsome prince,."
3350,70-1,"but at midnight, the spell is broken."
3351,70-1,and she runs away.
3352,70-1,and loses her shoe.
3353,70-1,And so now it's the quest of the the princess to find who fits the shoe.
3354,70-1,So he goes around to all the maidens.
3355,70-1,and tries has them try on the shoe.
3356,70-1,and the stepsisters try to try on the shoe.
3357,70-1,and of course it doesn't fit.
3358,70-1,"Meanwhile, somewhere in there, the um stepmother found the shoe that was remaining and um."
3359,70-1,And broke it.
3360,70-1,"I think that's what happened there, and then,."
3361,70-1,but Gus Gus found the other shoe.
3362,70-1,and was able to have The prince tried on on Cinderella.
3363,70-1,"and it fit,."
3364,70-1,and then they get married.
3365,70-1,and live happily ever after.
3366,70-1,Thank you very much.
3367,70-1,Oh.
3368,70-1,What was that?
3369,70-1,Like my oldest daughter could tell you the story of verbatim.
3370,70-1,She was like 2 or 3 years old.
3371,70-1,and she She could read the book.
3372,70-1,Oh gosh.
3373,70-1,Oh yeah.
3374,70-1,Right.
3375,70-1,Yeah.
3376,96-1,OK.
3377,96-1,"Um, so the story of Cinderella is."
3378,96-1,"that she, uh, her mother died when she was young,."
3379,96-1,"and she lived with her father, who eventually remarried."
3380,96-1,"To a woman with two daughters, but the new stepmother was not very nice, nor were her two daughters."
3381,96-1,So the father brought stepmom.
3382,96-1,"and the two daughters, introduced Cinderella proudly, um, but The stepmom."
3383,96-1,and two new stepsisters did not embrace Cinderella.
3384,96-1,and made it clear from the beginning.
3385,96-1,that she was going to be a second class citizen in the family.
3386,96-1,"Um, So When there was an invitation from the kingdom to come to a ball for all eligible unmarried young ladies to meet the prince, um, the two stepsisters got their invitations,."
3387,96-1,"but Cinderella did not get an invitation,."
3388,96-1,whether it was captured from the mail.
3389,96-1,"and hidden from her, or she just was so under the radar."
3390,96-1,that she didn't get an invitation has never been clear to me.
3391,96-1,"But in any case, um, The two stepsisters were invited."
3392,96-1,They were very excited.
3393,96-1,about going.
3394,96-1,They got to choose new outfits.
3395,96-1,And when Cinderella asked.
3396,96-1,"if she could go, um, the stepmother."
3397,96-1,"and stepsisters said, no, of course not, you can't go, you're just a, you're just here to clean out the chimney, um, sweep up the cinders."
3398,96-1,"You, you don't rate, you can't come to this um event."
3399,96-1,"So, Cinderella wistfully watches."
3400,96-1,as they um get gussied up.
3401,96-1,and head off to the ball.
3402,96-1,"after they leave, she goes back to a trunk."
3403,96-1,"that had been left to her, uh, by with some of her mother's things in it."
3404,96-1,And she finds a book.
3405,96-1,"Um,."
3406,96-1,"that when she opens it, uh, contains a spell."
3407,96-1,"that allows her to call up her own fairy godmother,."
3408,96-1,"and her fairy godmother appears,."
3409,96-1,and Cinderella tells her about the ball.
3410,96-1,"and how badly she wishes to go,."
3411,96-1,"and the fairy godmother, um, Generates a dress, a beautiful dress for Cinderella with glass slippers and is able to turn a pumpkin into a carriage."
3412,96-1,and mice are turned into horses.
3413,96-1,"that are going to pull her carriage,."
3414,96-1,and Cinderella goes off to the ball.
3415,96-1,"She meets, she has a wonderful time."
3416,96-1,"The prince dances with all the girls at the ball, um, including Cinderella,."
3417,96-1,"and they have a most special interaction during their dance,."
3418,96-1,"and he really wants to Continue dancing with her,."
3419,96-1,"but she knows, having been warned by her fairy godmother."
3420,96-1,that she has to leave at the stroke of midnight because all of her magical dress and carriage.
3421,96-1,and horses will disappear.
3422,96-1,and return back to what they were at midnight.
3423,96-1,So even.
3424,96-1,"though she's dancing with the prince, when she hears the bell."
3425,96-1,"about to strike midnight, she bolts, um,."
3426,96-1,and in her haste she leaves behind one of the glass slippers.
3427,96-1,"So Cinderella makes it home,."
3428,96-1,"but the prince doesn't know what has happened to her,."
3429,96-1,"and he goes the next morning to tell his father, the king,."
3430,96-1,that he met the woman.
3431,96-1,"that he wants to have, um, as his future queen."
3432,96-1,But all he has left to find her is this glass slipper.
3433,96-1,because he didn't get her name.
3434,96-1,"So, the king is frustrated?"
3435,96-1,"and it's like, you idiot, how could you make such a mistake?"
3436,96-1,"Um,."
3437,96-1,"and he sets off, the prince does, to find uh the woman who fits in the glass slipper."
3438,96-1,"Um, eventually, he goes to the home of Cinderella,."
3439,96-1,and the two stepsisters try to fit into the glass slipper.
3440,96-1,and pretend that they were the ones.
3441,96-1,that um he was dancing with.
3442,96-1,"and fell in love with,."
3443,96-1,but they don't fit into the glass slipper.
3444,96-1,"Um, and it's a little bit weird to me that the prince is only able to recognize his, you know, person that he was so interested in by her foot."
3445,96-1,"But notwithstanding, he continues to look for the person who wore the glass slipper."
3446,96-1,"And , um, I don't remember exactly how it comes about , while he is there, uh, She does come out from the, the fireplace cleaning."
3447,96-1,"and fits into the glass slipper,."
3448,96-1,and they take off.
3449,96-1,and live happily ever.
3450,270-1,The story.
3451,270-1,"that I can remember um from Cinderella story that Uh, this was a girl who was living somewhere not very well treated."
3452,270-1,"At some point, Um, She went somewhere."
3453,270-1,and had a pair of sandals.
3454,270-1,"The I guess she was gonna, she, she went out with somebody like a prince."
3455,270-1,And she's supposed to return home by midnight.
3456,270-1,if she didn't return.
3457,270-1,Then I guess you would turn into a pumpkin.
3458,270-1,"And the Sande story is That only one pair, only one of the pair was there."
3459,270-1,"and it had to fit according to the priest, it had to feed the person."
3460,270-1,"Um, that , that 's all I remember, no."
3461,270-1,OK.
3462,270-1,Yeah.
3463,neural28-1,OK.
3464,neural28-1,"Um, Cinderella's."
3465,neural28-1,My father met a woman.
3466,neural28-1,"and she had two children, two daughters of her own."
3467,neural28-1,"They were about the same age as Cinderella,."
3468,neural28-1,"and his dad decided to marry the woman, then the dad died,."
3469,neural28-1,and the stepmother raised.
3470,neural28-1,"The 3 girls, 2 of her own, and her stepdaughter, Cinderella,."
3471,neural28-1,and she treated Cinderella like a maid.
3472,neural28-1,"And not really like her, like the way she treated her two favorite daughters."
3473,neural28-1,And um Cinderella had to scrub the floors.
3474,neural28-1,and keep everything clean.
3475,neural28-1,and Cook.
3476,neural28-1,and wasn't allowed to do a lot of things.
3477,neural28-1,that the girls were doing.
3478,neural28-1,And there was a.
3479,neural28-1,They lived in a kingdom.
3480,neural28-1,that had a king.
3481,neural28-1,"And he had a son that was a prince,."
3482,neural28-1,"and he needed, he wanted to find, the king wanted to find a Princess, a woman to be the princess for her son, a bride,."
3483,neural28-1,and then they decided to hold a ball.
3484,neural28-1,"that they would invite all the kingdom, all the eligible ladies in the kingdom to come to."
3485,neural28-1,"So a notice was sent out,."
3486,neural28-1,and the stepmother read the notice and the girls were very excited.
3487,neural28-1,"Cinderella hadn't been to a ball, so she was very, very excited."
3488,neural28-1,"And then the stepmother had beautiful dresses made for her two daughters, but not Cinderella, and Cinderella."
3489,neural28-1,"With the help of her forest friends, or her animal friends, um,."
3490,neural28-1,"and a fairy godmother, made a, uh a beautiful dress."
3491,neural28-1,"Um, well, I guess the fairy godmother didn't help that yet."
3492,neural28-1,"Well, Cinderella made a dress,."
3493,neural28-1,"and , um, then she was planning to go."
3494,neural28-1,"and the stepmother said, no, you're not going anywhere."
3495,neural28-1,You're going to stay home.
3496,neural28-1,and clean the house.
3497,neural28-1,We're going to the ball.
3498,neural28-1,And Cinderella was sad.
3499,neural28-1,"Then she Um, Had her dress kind of tore up by the stepmothers, by the stepsisters,."
3500,neural28-1,"and then everyone left for the ball except for Cinderella,."
3501,neural28-1,and then she made a wish and the fairy godmother was there.
3502,neural28-1,and she granted her wish to To.
3503,neural28-1,"that she would get to go to the ball, so using the forest animals, they created a, everything she needed a beautiful gown, they turned the pumpkin into a coach, they changed the mice into horses."
3504,neural28-1,"And um everybody participated,."
3505,neural28-1,but the thing is they told her she had to be home by midnight when the clock struck midnight.
3506,neural28-1,because the magic would wear off.
3507,neural28-1,"So Cinderella went to the ball,."
3508,neural28-1,and she came in.
3509,neural28-1,"and everybody was, um, since it was a Uh, kind of a masquerade kind of ball too."
3510,neural28-1,Not everybody knew who everybody was.
3511,neural28-1,Depends on which version you watch.
3512,neural28-1,Um So she went in.
3513,neural28-1,and everyone danced with the prince.
3514,neural28-1,"and the prince fell in love with Cinderella, um,."
3515,neural28-1,"and wanted to dance the night away with her,."
3516,neural28-1,"but she noticed it was getting close to midnight, so she was leaving the ball."
3517,neural28-1,and he was chasing her.
3518,neural28-1,"And then when she was going, Um, when she was on the steps, she lost one of her class slippers, which miraculously didn't change back into what it was."
3519,neural28-1,"Prior, um,."
3520,neural28-1,And she got to the cart just.
3521,neural28-1,"as the, she got to the carriage just."
3522,neural28-1,as it was striking midnight.
3523,neural28-1,"And then on our way home, it changed back into forest animals and vegetables or pumpkins."
3524,neural28-1,But she got home.
3525,neural28-1,"and Cinderella's sisters got home, stepsisters got home with her mom,."
3526,neural28-1,"and they couldn't believe who this girl was, who was at the ball,."
3527,neural28-1,that they weren't treated like they were the fairest of them all.
3528,neural28-1,"The prince wanted to find out who it was that was at the ball,."
3529,neural28-1,"since no one knew who Cinderella was,."
3530,neural28-1,and he decided to go on a search for the love of his life.
3531,neural28-1,"Um,."
3532,neural28-1,by having all the girls in the kingdom try on the glass slipper.
3533,neural28-1,And he searched.
3534,neural28-1,"and he searched,."
3535,neural28-1,and then he finally stopped at the The house where Cinderella.
3536,neural28-1,"and her family lived,."
3537,neural28-1,"and they tried the slippers on the sisters, so each of the girls tried to shove their feet in them,."
3538,neural28-1,but they didn't fit.
3539,neural28-1,And then they whined.
3540,neural28-1,and then they weren't gonna try.
3541,neural28-1,Anybody else.
3542,neural28-1,cause they didn't know about Cinderella.
3543,neural28-1,and then somebody in his um party saw her.
3544,neural28-1,and they tried it on.
3545,neural28-1,"They said, no, we have to try it on her."
3546,neural28-1,"and the stepmother says no, she wasn't even at the ball,."
3547,neural28-1,and then they tried it on her.
3548,neural28-1,"and it fit,."
3549,neural28-1,and then they fell in love.
3550,neural28-1,"and Cinderella got to move away from the Wicked stepmother,."
3551,neural28-1,and then the prince lived happily ever after and hopefully Cinderella.
3552,neural28-1,Didn't talk to her stepsisters anymore.
3553,neural28-1,"No, I'm just joking."
3554,neural28-1,"No, yeah, hopefully they live happily ever after."
3555,neural39-1,"You have stepmother with her two girls, and then Cinderella and her father."
3556,neural39-1,"Um, I guess something happened to him."
3557,neural39-1,"That one I don't remember,."
3558,neural39-1,but Cinderella winds up in the family of the stepmother with the two other sisters.
3559,neural39-1,"Um, those sisters are jealous of her,."
3560,neural39-1,and Let's see.
3561,neural39-1,"Um,."
3562,neural39-1,"In comes, uh, Cinderella spends a lot of time by herself."
3563,neural39-1,"In comes the invitation to a ball, which the stepsisters are very excited about."
3564,neural39-1,"So is Cinderella, assuming."
3565,neural39-1,"that she's gonna go, um, The Um, Cinderella, I guess then pulled out the trunk."
3566,neural39-1,and found the Book.
3567,neural39-1,and made a dress.
3568,neural39-1,And the stepsisters ripped it all up.
3569,neural39-1,"And I believe, let's see, then the fairy godmother gets in there."
3570,neural39-1,and whips her up a dress with her magic wand.
3571,neural39-1,And then reminds her.
3572,neural39-1,that she has to be home by midnight.
3573,neural39-1,And let's see.
3574,neural39-1,She got.
3575,neural39-1,to having a good time dancing at that ball.
3576,neural39-1,and forgot about the midnight.
3577,neural39-1,"Running down the steps, she lost the glass, one of the glass slippers."
3578,neural39-1,"Um, she got home."
3579,neural39-1,"and saw her one glass slipper, and Prince was pretty upset that his lover, his pride."
3580,neural39-1,"and joy had disappeared, so he did find the glass slipper on the stair,."
3581,neural39-1,and he had his guys go throughout the kingdom.
3582,neural39-1,"to see who this little slipper fit,."
3583,neural39-1,and I remember.
3584,neural39-1,"in the movie, the, the stepsisters tried."
3585,neural39-1,to um Put that on.
3586,neural39-1,and even we're cutting off their toes.
3587,neural39-1,to make it fit.
3588,neural39-1,"And , oh yeah, she had gotten locked in there."
3589,neural39-1,The little mice let her out of the room.
3590,neural39-1,"because when they came, um, they didn't want Cinderella slipping out."
3591,neural39-1,"So, yes, she was able."
3592,neural39-1,to put on the slipper.
3593,neural39-1,and she lived happily ever after.
3594,wright03a,"All right, this is, this is, uh, Walt Disney's version of Cinderella."

3661,45-1,"Hoping that one of , Her daughters."
3662,45-1,Would be picked by the prince.
3663,45-1,"Possibly be, become a future wife."
3664,45-1,and eventually become a wife.
3665,45-1,Of a cane.
3666,45-1,She was only preparing two daughters to go to the ball.
3667,45-1,And would not allow Cinderella to participate.
3668,45-1,"And ,."
3669,45-1,"and when I think about this story, I, I always thought it was possibly 3 daughters."
3670,45-1,"I, I'm not sure if Cinderella was a servant or not, but my understanding was Cinderella was one of 3 daughters."
3671,45-1,"For lack of a better word, she was the gorgeous one in the family."
3672,45-1,And mother did not want her to participate.
3673,45-1,One.
3674,45-1,of the pictures showed where.
3675,45-1,"And she was getting dressed, as a result."
3676,45-1,"of her trying to get dressed, mother did not want her to go to the ball."
3677,45-1,"So, uh, she was depressed."
3678,45-1,And mother gave her additional work to do.
3679,45-1,While the other girls were preparing to go to the ball.
3680,45-1,"So, uh, she was obedient."
3681,45-1,Did the things.
3682,45-1,that she was told to do.
3683,45-1,"as the other young ladies went to the ball, she stayed home."
3684,45-1,and took care of the house the way mother had instructed her to do.
3685,45-1,"But somewhere in a vision, Which I saw here."
3686,45-1,A young lady came by with a magic wand.
3687,45-1,"And the vision, the picture indicated."
3688,45-1,that you should go to the ball.
3689,45-1,"She didn't know how she was gonna go to the ball,."
3690,45-1,"but When a light, according to the picture, lit up."
3691,45-1,All.
3692,45-1,"of a sudden, Cinderella had this beautiful dress on."
3693,45-1,"I didn't see it in the story here about the pumpkin becoming a, a carb."
3694,45-1,But she was transported to the mall.
3695,45-1,And the French observed all of the other women that were at the ball.
3696,45-1,"for whatever reason it was, Cinderella was the last one."
3697,45-1,that came in.
3698,45-1,"Based on the pictures, she was the most beautiful one of them all."
3699,45-1,"And with that beauty, the prince was excited about her."
3700,45-1,He approached her.
3701,45-1,They danced one time.
3702,45-1,The illustration.
3703,45-1,that you showed me did not say that at midnight.
3704,45-1,The beauty.
3705,45-1,that you have with the dress and everything else.
3706,45-1,that you have on will disappear.
3707,45-1,"as time got close to midnight, she departed the castle."
3708,45-1,"as she was walking down the steps, she lost a shoe."
3709,45-1,"One of the shoes that the, That was Part of the dressing."
3710,45-1,for her to be prepared to go to the event.
3711,45-1,And eventually she went home.
3712,45-1,"Uh, the pranks found the shoe."
3713,45-1,And because of his concern and possible love.
3714,45-1,that he had for this young lady named Cinderella.
3715,45-1,He had communicated with his dad.
3716,45-1,and talked about how important it was for him to find that maiden.
3717,45-1,That wore these shoes.
3718,45-1,"So, uh, He and others were not."
3719,45-1,Into the land around the castle.
3720,45-1,Trying to find a young lady.
3721,45-1,that would fit into this shoe.
3722,45-1,Eventually he got to the house of Cinderella.
3723,45-1,"And naturally, The mother."
3724,45-1,of the house was hoping that the two young ladies.
3725,45-1,"that she had there, the ugly ones."
3726,45-1,"Would fit into the shoe, thus eventually becoming."
3727,45-1,The Wife of a possible king.
3728,45-1,"And she did everything possible to make sure those shoes would fit,."
3729,45-1,but they would not.
3730,45-1,"But to the prince's surprise, he saw the maiden of Cinderella."
3731,45-1,And he asked her.
3732,45-1,if she would try on a shoe.
3733,45-1,"Eventually Cinderella's side, tried the shoe on, the shoe would fit."
3734,45-1,And The prince was excited.
3735,45-1,Cinderella was excited.
3736,45-1,The Mother was not too excited.
3737,45-1,"Eventually,."
3738,45-1,and I didn't see it in the illustrations here in pictures.
3739,45-1,"But eventually, Cinderella."
3740,45-1,And the prince return.
3741,45-1,To the castle.
3742,45-1,And ended up.
3743,45-1,"Again, it doesn't show it,."
3744,45-1,but we know.
3745,45-1,"They ended up having a, a great life together."
3746,45-1,"Eventually, possibly he became king."
3747,45-1,And she became his queen.
3748,capilouto01a,OK.
3749,capilouto01a,"Once upon a time, uh, there was a little girl named Cinderella,."
3750,capilouto01a,"and , um, her mother passed away."
3751,capilouto01a,and then eventually her father married again.
3752,capilouto01a,"and he didn't realize that the woman he married was so wicked,."
3753,capilouto01a,but then the father passed away.
3754,capilouto01a,and so Cinderella was left to the wicked stepmother.
3755,capilouto01a,and uh she had uh two ugly daughters.
3756,capilouto01a,"And Cinderella was really pretty, so they were really jealous of her and uh so."
3757,capilouto01a,"and then uh the prince of this little town became of age where the father, the king, wanted him to marry."
3758,capilouto01a,"and so he announced, had his um A man, one of his servants, announced."
3759,capilouto01a,"that there would be a, a ball,."
3760,capilouto01a,"and all of the young ladies who were eligible to, uh, marry the prince were invited to the ball, and Cinderella was so excited about it,."
3761,capilouto01a,and she made herself a lovely dress to wear.
3762,capilouto01a,"So then when the two stepsisters saw how pretty she was and her dress was so pretty, they tore it all to pieces."
3763,capilouto01a,So she had nothing to wear to the ball.
3764,capilouto01a,"and her stepmother told her she couldn't go anyway,."
3765,capilouto01a,"that she had to go stay in her room,."
3766,capilouto01a,and she was crying.
3767,capilouto01a,and crying.
3768,capilouto01a,and her uh her fairy godmother showed up.
3769,capilouto01a,and um wanted to ask her what was wrong.
3770,capilouto01a,"and she said, well, she wanted to go to the ball,."
3771,capilouto01a,but she didn't have anything to wear.
3772,capilouto01a,So the fairy godmother just waves her wand.
3773,capilouto01a,"and um Boom, uh, Cinderella just appears in this beautiful dress and then the fairy god."
3774,capilouto01a,Turns a pumpkin into a beautiful coach and uh the uh dog and the cat into the to the uh footmen and the mice into horses.
3775,capilouto01a,and away they go in the carriage.
3776,capilouto01a,"uh Cinderella traveled in the carriage to the ball and when she entered, she was so beautiful."
3777,capilouto01a,The prince was just really taken with her.
3778,capilouto01a,and he danced with her all evening.
3779,capilouto01a,And uh.
3780,capilouto01a,but the fairy godmother had warned her.
3781,capilouto01a,that she had to be home before the stroke of midnight because at that point everything would return the way it was.
3782,capilouto01a,The coach would be a pumpkin.
3783,capilouto01a,"The footman would be the dog and the cat, and the horses would be mice, and Cinderella's dress would be gone."
3784,capilouto01a,"And um,."
3785,capilouto01a,but she had.
3786,capilouto01a,Given her some lovely glass slippers to wear and apparently she was able to keep the slippers.
3787,capilouto01a,"So then, um, the prince, uh, she, uh, they were dancing."
3788,capilouto01a,"and at 12 o'clock, the, um, she, when she heard the clock strike 12, she ran."
3789,capilouto01a,because she knew she had to get out of there really fast.
3790,capilouto01a,"And on the way she lost one of her glass slippers,."
3791,capilouto01a,"and the prince chased after her,."
3792,capilouto01a,"but then he lost sight of her,."
3793,capilouto01a,but he found the slipper.
3794,capilouto01a,"and carried, kept it with him,."
3795,capilouto01a,and then he just pined away.
3796,capilouto01a,because he'd lost this lovely lady.
3797,capilouto01a,And who he really had fallen in love with.
3798,capilouto01a,and wanted to make his wife.
3799,capilouto01a,and so um the king ordered one of his servants to take the glass slipper around the village.
3800,capilouto01a,and have the maidens try it.
3801,capilouto01a,"and when it was a perfect fit, he knew."
3802,capilouto01a,that he had found the one.
3803,capilouto01a,"Uh,."
3804,capilouto01a,that the prince had fallen in love with.
3805,capilouto01a,"So, uh, when he went to the home of the, uh, ugly stepsisters, they tried to force their big feet into the, their big foot into the slipper,."
3806,capilouto01a,and it just wouldn't work.
3807,capilouto01a,"And so, They said, Is there anyone else here in the house?"
3808,capilouto01a,"And , uh, the wicked stepmother said, no, no, but with."
3809,capilouto01a,"that , Cinderella comes running out."
3810,capilouto01a,"and wanted to try the slipper too,."
3811,capilouto01a,"and her foot just went into it perfectly,."
3812,capilouto01a,and so they knew they had found the right person and so she.
3813,capilouto01a,and the prince were married.
3814,capilouto01a,and lived happily ever after.
3815,capilouto02a,Cinderella.
3816,capilouto02a,Is she's sent to work in this castle.
3817,capilouto02a,And in the castle.
3818,capilouto02a,Is the wicked queen and her three daughters.
3819,capilouto02a,And uh 33 daughters want to go to the ball.
3820,capilouto02a,The prince.
3821,capilouto02a,Has to He has a slipper.
3822,capilouto02a,"And the slipper, he's trying to find out who the slipper fits,."
3823,capilouto02a,"and he's going to take to the ball, whoever the slipper fits."
3824,capilouto02a,"And now the, the, the daughters try it,."
3825,capilouto02a,"but they can't, they try to force it on."
3826,capilouto02a,And even.
3827,capilouto02a,"if they force it on themselves, they still can't really fit."
3828,capilouto02a,"that Uh, slipper very well."
3829,capilouto02a,So the slipper fits on Cinderella.
3830,capilouto02a,"But the thing is, At 12 o'clock, if she's not home, she'll change back to a pumpkin."
3831,capilouto02a,"Or , yeah, let's, let's let it go like."
3832,capilouto02a,that She changed it into a pumpkin.
3833,capilouto02a,"And , Uh, The, so, somehow, so Cinderella, uh, so they go to the ball, the, the, The wicked daughters are the daughter of the wicked witch."
3834,capilouto02a,"And goes, goes, goes to the, they, they, 3 of them go to the ball,."
3835,capilouto02a,"and Cinderella goes to the ball, and Cinderella is the kind of the star of the ball."
3836,capilouto02a,"And Uh, She, they, they're leaving, Just around."
3837,capilouto02a,12 o'clock.
3838,capilouto02a,"that , Changes into a punk,."
3839,capilouto02a,"That has, at 12 o'clock, Cinderella changes back to a, she's, becomes her scullery maid, is a scullery."
3840,capilouto02a,Person.
3841,capilouto02a,"And , uh, I guess the prince knows that , Uh, Cinderella is the one who wore the, uh, Uh, slipper,."
3842,capilouto02a,"and so he, he, uh, Um marry Cinderella."
3843,capilouto02a,and everything ends up happily ever after.
3844,30-1,OK.
3845,30-1,"So, Cinderella's father married a woman who had 3 daughters, 3 stepdaughters, and they were very mean to her."
3846,30-1,and treated her like a maid.
3847,30-1,And they were all gonna go to the ball.
3848,30-1,because the prince was gonna pick a a new bride.
3849,30-1,"And , um, she had the little birds."
3850,30-1,"and stuff helped her make a dress, which they, um, sisters took off of her."
3851,30-1,And were mean to her.
3852,30-1,and then her fairy godmother came.
3853,30-1,and fairy godmother put her in a dress.
3854,30-1,"and turned a pumpkin into a coach,."
3855,30-1,"and she went to the um ball,."
3856,30-1,but she had to leave by midnight.
3857,30-1,"When she left, she lost a slipper on the steps, and the prince was in love with her,."
3858,30-1,"and he had to find out whose slipper that was,."
3859,30-1,and he finally found her.
3860,30-1,and put the slipper on her foot.
3861,30-1,"And they lived happily ever after, I'm sure."
3862,234-1,Cinderella is the story of a girl whose father Marries a second wife.
3863,234-1,The second wife comes with two daughters.
3864,234-1,"She is the wicked stepmother, evil stepmother, as Disney is prone to , and the two stepdaughters are not very nice either."
3865,234-1,"Cinderella, who used to be the pride."
3866,234-1,"and joy of her father, is now relegated to being the house servant."
3867,234-1,And she probably sleeps under the stairs.
3868,234-1,"and is treated badly by everybody, but her father is not strong enough."
3869,234-1,"to stand up to his new wife, the nasty stepmother, and the two daughters."
3870,234-1,"One day, the prince who is being told he must get married."
3871,234-1,"Besides, they decide."
3872,234-1,to hold a ball for the prince that all the eligible princesses.
3873,234-1,and all the eligible people around can come.
3874,234-1,and meet the prince.
3875,234-1,and he will choose a wife.
3876,234-1,"The stepmother and the stepdaughters, of course, are all very excited."
3877,234-1,to be excited.
3878,234-1,to uh invited to the ball.
3879,234-1,They all get dressed up.
3880,234-1,"Cinderella is told that she is too poor and nasty and ugly,."
3881,234-1,"and she can't go,."
3882,234-1,so she very sadly stays home.
3883,234-1,And they all head out to the ball.
3884,234-1,uh.
3885,234-1,"Turns out she has a fairy godmother, who appears."
3886,234-1,"and with a wave of her wand, Cinderella is dressed as the most beautiful, and her friends, the mice and the and the horse and the other critters."
3887,234-1,that she has befriended in her loneliness are all turned into her carriage.
3888,234-1,"and her pumpkin, her pumpkin has turned into a carriage."
3889,234-1,and she heads off to the ball in in elegant style.
3890,234-1,"Knowing, being told very clearly by her fairy godmother that she must be back at midnight."
3891,234-1,"because all of this magic will disappear, and she will just be a drudge, and they will just be mice, pumpkins, and horses."
3892,234-1,So she heads off.
3893,234-1,"to the ball, of course, the prince, the handsome prince falls in love with her immediately."
3894,234-1,They dance all night.
3895,234-1,They have a wonderful time.
3896,234-1,The clock starts to strike midnight.
3897,234-1,and she runs away.
3898,234-1,because she knows.
3899,234-1,that she's going.
3900,234-1,to be turned back into a scullery maid.
3901,234-1,So she runs away and in.
3902,234-1,that process loses one of her glass slippers.
3903,234-1,And uh she makes it back out into the street.
3904,234-1,"before anybody sees her turn into a drudge, and all."
3905,234-1,that 's left is the slipper.
3906,234-1,"that the prince finds,."
3907,234-1,And he decides.
3908,234-1,or His solution.
3909,234-1,to look for the woman of his dreams and the the woman he's going.
3910,234-1,to marry is.
3911,234-1,to go to all households in the Country or whatever size arrangement they have there.
3912,234-1,"to pick up,."
3913,234-1,"to find who fits into that slipper, that person will be the person."
3914,234-1,that he marries.
3915,234-1,He shows up at the house.
3916,234-1,"and the stepmother is not, she tries it on, can't do it."
3917,234-1,"In one of the grizzly stories of this, one of the stepsisters cuts off her toes."
3918,234-1,To try.
3919,234-1,to fit into the shoe.
3920,234-1,and the other stepsister cuts off her heel.
3921,234-1,to try.
3922,234-1,"to fit in the shoe,."
3923,234-1,but I don't know.
3924,234-1,if the Disney version had.
3925,234-1,"that Um,."
3926,234-1,"that was, I think, in the darker original."
3927,214-1,"OK, once upon a time."
3928,214-1,There was a woman who had two not very attractive looking and not very pleasant daughters.
3929,214-1,And she remarries.
3930,214-1,"and The apparently a wealthy gentleman, it was described in the book, the pictures, also has a pretty nice looking daughter who is younger than the two stepdaughters,."
3931,214-1,"and he he introduces his daughter to his his new wife and her new stepmother,."
3932,214-1,and I don't think he is ever present again in the story.
3933,214-1,Uh Somehow a grand announcement is made.
3934,214-1,"that There's going to be a big special fancy ball with local nobility,."
3935,214-1,"and the general public is is invited as well,."
3936,214-1,and Cinderella goes to her own trunk of clothes.
3937,214-1,and pulls out a very nice looking dress.
3938,214-1,"that she proposes wearing to the ball, and her two stepsisters, stepsisters,."
3939,214-1,"and her stepmother has an absolute fit, tell her no way is she going to leave the house dressed like."
3940,214-1,"And so, Uh, Cinderella takes off the dress."
3941,214-1,"and puts it away, and The stepmother."
3942,214-1,"and stepdaughters go off the ball, uh without Cinderella, who has to stay home."
3943,214-1,"There she somehow has an encounter with mice and a fairy godmother who Embellishes her with really great looking clothes, a very fancy carriage ride to the ball with and there."
3944,214-1,She's warned.
3945,214-1,that she has to leave before the stroke of midnight.
3946,214-1,or everything will disappear.
3947,214-1,"And come midnight, she hears the clock sounding,."
3948,214-1,and she flees on her own.
3949,214-1,and barely gets out of the place she.
3950,214-1,"while she's running away, she loses a slipper."
3951,214-1,And then She gets home and the prince.
3952,214-1,"Uh, finds the slipper."
3953,214-1,and announces that 's who he really wants to be.
3954,214-1,And Other Back totems Servants of the king go out through the village trying to identify.
3955,214-1,"Uh, the slipper belongs to."
3956,214-1,"And Thereupon The two step stepdaughters, stepsisters."
3957,214-1,"Cannot by any means get their foot into the slipper,."
3958,214-1,and Cinderella's slipper fits just perfectly.
3959,214-1,And She is escorted back to the palace.
3960,214-1,She's induced introduced the prince.
3961,214-1,The prince recognizes her without the the finery.
3962,214-1,And she is welcomed into the household of the king and the prince.
3963,214-1,"and Um, the, the mice celebrate."
3964,214-1,and the fairy godmother says she's done her job and everybody is perfectly happy with the results except the stepmother and the stepdaughters who uh.
3965,214-1,Take all rigged.
3966,214-1,and They were cheated.
3967,214-1,The end.
3968,81-1,"OK, so, uh, once upon a time there was a Um, young woman named Cinderella, who was hired by a family to be their housekeeper."
3969,81-1,The family consisted of a mother who was Kind of mean.
3970,81-1,And Her two daughters.
3971,81-1,"While Cinderella was kind of being adopted by the family, they put her to work as a housekeeper."
3972,81-1,"So she saw the family as her stepmother and stepsisters, that was not the relationship."
3973,81-1,Um.
3974,81-1,Because they were mean.
3975,81-1,and always made fun of her.
3976,81-1,and put her to work.
3977,81-1,"Um, one day, the mother got a notice."
3978,81-1,that there was gonna be a big ball.
3979,81-1,"And the prince was gonna be there, and the mother was so excited and she."
3980,81-1,"and her stepdaughters got ready for the ball,."
3981,81-1,and the daughters were um preparing their beautiful dresses.
3982,81-1,and excited to go to the ball.
3983,81-1,because they thought they would have an opportunity.
3984,81-1,for one of them to meet the prince.
3985,81-1,and live happily ever after.
3986,81-1,Cinderella overheard all of this.
3987,81-1,"And just wished she could go to the ball,."
3988,81-1,but thought it was impossible because she's just the maid.
3989,81-1,and she didn't have any clothes.
3990,81-1,"Um, her animal friends, she loved the animals who lived on the property."
3991,81-1,"They, um, Encouraged her."
3992,81-1,"and told her she could do it,."
3993,81-1,"and her fairy godmother appeared, I think it was her fairy godmother,."
3994,81-1,and helped her put together a beautiful outfit.
3995,81-1,I think the animals helped with the sewing of the beautiful dress.
3996,81-1,and um The fairy godmother gave her some beautiful glittery shoes.
3997,81-1,"and said, these are."
3998,81-1,"for you, you are going to look beautiful,."
3999,81-1,but the only caveat is you have to be home by midnight.
4000,81-1,"So Cinderella agreed, she got dressed, she went to the ball."
4001,81-1,and looked beautiful.
4002,81-1,um her stepsisters and stepmother were there.
4003,81-1,"And they were all appalled that she could be there, and how could she be there in her beautiful dress, um, and lo."
4004,81-1,"and behold, the prince saw Cinderella."
4005,81-1,and immediately fell in love with her.
4006,81-1,and Wanted to be with her.
4007,81-1,"And marry her, um, but Cinderella was so flustered."
4008,81-1,"that um she almost forgot about her, um, curfew of midnight."
4009,81-1,"So it was just about to Turn 12 midnight,."
4010,81-1,"and so she ran out of there in time to get home,."
4011,81-1,"but in her haste, her shoe fell off."
4012,81-1,"Um,."
4013,81-1,that was left behind.
4014,81-1,as she ran all the way home.
4015,81-1,So she got back home.
4016,81-1,She was feeling sad.
4017,81-1,that she couldn't have Stayed longer with the prince.
4018,81-1,The sisters and the stepmother were all mad that she was there.
4019,81-1,And lo.
4020,81-1,"and behold, there was a knock on the door, and it was the prince, and the mother and the stepmother and stepsisters were so excited."
4021,81-1,that the prince came back.
4022,81-1,"and he said, I want to, um, see Cinderella."
4023,81-1,"I, I met her at the ball."
4024,81-1,She left her shoe behind.
4025,81-1,and I'm bringing it back to her.
4026,81-1,And then Cinderella came out.
4027,81-1,"and she, oh wait, now let me go back."
4028,81-1,"He said, I have this shoe."
4029,81-1,and I want to be with the person.
4030,81-1,that this shoe fits.
4031,81-1,So the two stepsisters tried it on.
4032,81-1,"and it, it didn't fit, and they were so upset."
4033,81-1,And then Cinderella came out.
4034,81-1,and he asked Cinderella to try on the shoe.
4035,81-1,"and the stepsister said, Well, that 's ridiculous, it's not gonna fit her."
4036,81-1,"Um,."
4037,81-1,but it did.
4038,81-1,"So the prince knew that she was the one he wanted to be with,."
4039,81-1,and he asked.
4040,81-1,"Cinderella to marry him,."
4041,81-1,"and she said yes,."
4042,81-1,and they lived happily ever after.
4043,wright02a,OK.
4044,wright02a,"Once upon a time, long, long ago in the land of make-believe."
4045,wright02a,There was a man who had lost his wife.
4046,wright02a,"had a young daughter, a sweet young woman."
4047,wright02a,Sweet young girl by the name of Cinderella.
4048,wright02a,He decided it was time.
4049,wright02a,"that he got, took a wife for himself."
4050,wright02a,and got a mother for Cinderella.
4051,wright02a,because she needed a woman.
4052,wright02a,as she was growing.
4053,wright02a,The mother.
4054,wright02a,And so he married.
4055,wright02a,"A widow, a lady who did not have a husband."
4056,wright02a,but had two young daughters.
4057,wright02a,The woman who was Cinderella's stepmother.
4058,wright02a,Came into the household.
4059,wright02a,and decided that Cinderella.
4060,wright02a,was just not going to.
4061,wright02a,Cut the ice with her.
4062,wright02a,And she banished her.
4063,wright02a,"To the kitchen to do lots of chores, lots of jobs,."
4064,wright02a,and her told her own two little girls who were really nasty little brats.
4065,wright02a,"Got to sit around, get lots of new clothes,."
4066,wright02a,and do nothing all day long.
4067,wright02a,while Cinderella worked.
4068,wright02a,and worked.
4069,wright02a,and cleaned.
4070,wright02a,and cooked.
4071,wright02a,"But she had her little cat whom she loved,."
4072,wright02a,and the cat kept her company.
4073,wright02a,and helped as much.
4074,wright02a,as she could.
4075,wright02a,And this went on.
4076,wright02a,Daddy was completely unaware.
4077,wright02a,He did not know what was going on.
4078,wright02a,And so he blithely went along his way.
4079,wright02a,"Enjoying his wife, his two stepchildren, and every once in a."
4080,wright02a,"while seeing his daughter, who was so sweet."
4081,wright02a,and didn't complain to.
4082,wright02a,"Meanwhile, in this kingdom."
4083,wright02a,that they lived so long ago and far The king.
4084,wright02a,and queen decided that their oldest son.
4085,wright02a,Need to get married.
4086,wright02a,It was time.
4087,wright02a,"And so they planned a great ball, which is a big, big party with lots of dancing and music and people."
4088,wright02a,And they send out a herald that is a messenger.
4089,wright02a,Told everyone throughout the land.
4090,wright02a,"that all the single girls were to come, all the single young women,."
4091,wright02a,"because they had to be old enough to get married, to come to this big fancy party in their prettiest dresses."
4092,wright02a,"And so the stepmother heard about this and was very, very excited."
4093,wright02a,because maybe one of her girls could marry the prince.
4094,wright02a,And she plotted.
4095,wright02a,and planned.
4096,wright02a,and got the girls the most gorgeous dresses she could get.
4097,wright02a,"Meanwhile, poor Cinderella didn't get."
4098,wright02a,Wasn't going to get to go.
4099,wright02a,"Her stepmother said, No, you have to help me get the girls ready."
4100,wright02a,"and dressed,."
4101,wright02a,and then you have work to do.
4102,wright02a,"Keep this house clean, you have to make sure."
4103,wright02a,that it is *** and span when the prince comes to claim his bride.
4104,wright02a,"Poor Cinderella, after the, Girls."
4105,wright02a,and their stepmother left for the ball.
4106,wright02a,She sat.
4107,wright02a,and sat.
4108,wright02a,and cried.
4109,wright02a,She wanted to go to this fancy party also.

4111,wright02a,"And a balloon came down,."
4112,wright02a,and it got bigger and bigger and brighter.

4178,wright02a,The stepsisters don't recognize her.
4179,wright02a,The stepmother doesn't recognize her.
4180,wright02a,"They have never seen her, so nice and pretty and clean and all dressed up."
4181,wright02a,Cinderella is having a wonderful time.
4182,wright02a,All of a sudden.
4183,wright02a,Clock starts to strike 12.
4184,wright02a,"Oh, she remembers."
4185,wright02a,"Gotta go, gotta go, she tells the prince and scoots off."
4186,wright02a,"Runs and runs, but the prince is so startled."
4187,wright02a,"He doesn't Realize what's happening,."
4188,wright02a,and she gets all the way out from the palace.
4189,wright02a,Before the clock finished striking.
4190,wright02a,The coach disappears.
4191,wright02a,Her beautiful dress disappears.
4192,wright02a,"Everything,."
4193,wright02a,"as she had been running, she lost her shoe."
4194,wright02a,Now.

4196,wright02a,Before you ask me why.
4197,wright02a,"that doesn't happen, I had kids who, uh, Ask questions."
4198,wright02a,"So, she keeps running."
4199,wright02a,"Eventually, she gets home."
4200,wright02a,Back to her heart.
4201,wright02a,The pumpkin cyst squashed.
4202,wright02a,The prince has only the shoe.
4203,wright02a,But he has fallen in love with Cinderella.
4204,wright02a,A proclamation goes out the next day.
4205,wright02a,"He wishes to see every woman, every young woman in the."

4212,wright02a,"Some's too big, too narrow, too wide, too small, too this, too."
4213,wright02a,that Gets to the house of Cinderella.
4214,wright02a,Older stepsister trazodone?

4216,wright02a,Her mother tries.
4217,wright02a,and they push.
4218,wright02a,and they push.
4219,wright02a,and it doesn't fit.
4220,wright02a,"The other sister says, try."
4221,wright02a,They push.
4222,wright02a,and they squeeze.
4223,wright02a,and they push.
4224,wright02a,"and they squeeze,."

4229,wright02a,"No, says the stepmother."
4230,wright02a,There's nobody else.
4231,wright02a,"At that point, Cinderella peeks around the corner."
4232,wright02a,And the messenger sees her.
4233,wright02a,"Well, here's a young lady."
4234,wright02a,Let us Let me try you.
4235,wright02a,We've got to try it.

4237,wright02a,"though the stepmother is saying, no, she's nothing, she's nothing."
4238,wright02a,"So, Cinderella comes in the room."
4239,wright02a,Slips her foot in easily into the glass slipper.
4240,wright02a,"It's not too big, it's not too small, not too wide, not too narrow."
4241,wright02a,"The messenger says, Proclaim, I have found the princess."
4242,wright02a,Prince.
4243,wright02a,The prince comes to claim Cinderella.
4244,wright02a,And they get married.
4245,wright02a,and live happily ever after.
4246,wright02a,"And yes, the stepsisters."
4247,wright02a,Mended their ways.
4248,wright02a,"And really became nice little girl, nice girls."
4249,wright02a,"Instead of the mean, spiteful ones."
4250,wright02a,that they had been.
4251,wright02a,20 minutes.
4252,wright02a,It's very de that 's great.
4253,neural24-1,"Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Cinderella, whose mother died when she was little."
4254,neural24-1,"and she lived with her father,."
4255,neural24-1,and he decided he would get remarried.
4256,neural24-1,"So he married a lady who had two little girls,."
4257,neural24-1,and they became her stepsisters.
4258,neural24-1,"But then he died,."
4259,neural24-1,"and they grew up, and the stepsisters were very mean to Cinderella."
4260,neural24-1,They made her do all the chores in the house.
4261,neural24-1,"Well,."
4262,neural24-1,and her stepmother made her do it too.
4263,neural24-1,She had to do all the cooking and the cleaning.
4264,neural24-1,and taking care of their clothes.
4265,neural24-1,"And doing their laundry, and she, she was very sad."
4266,neural24-1,But then one day she was looking out the window.
4267,neural24-1,"and saw the castle in the distance,."
4268,neural24-1,and thought there had to be something better out there.
4269,neural24-1,And lo.
4270,neural24-1,"and behold, they got a letter."
4271,neural24-1,There was going to be a ball.
4272,neural24-1,It was time for the prince to get married.
4273,neural24-1,The king decided he had to get his son married.
4274,neural24-1,So they were all excited.
4275,neural24-1,"and getting ready to go to the ball,."
4276,neural24-1,"and Cinderella wanted to go to the ball,."
4277,neural24-1,"but her stepmother said, no, no, no, that 's not for you."
4278,neural24-1,You've got work to do here.
4279,neural24-1,But Cinderella had lots of animal friends from being nice to them.
4280,neural24-1,"and growing up with them, and they, the mice."
4281,neural24-1,"and the birds, they all made her a beautiful gown,."
4282,neural24-1,and she put it on.
4283,neural24-1,and she ran down to say that she was ready to go to the ball too.
4284,neural24-1,"But her stepsisters were very mean,."
4285,neural24-1,and they ripped.
4286,neural24-1,"and they tore her dress,."
4287,neural24-1,"and they, she couldn't go."
4288,neural24-1,"cause she didn't have anything to wear,."
4289,neural24-1,"and they went off to the ball,."
4290,neural24-1,"and she was crying,."
4291,neural24-1,"and she went up to her room,."
4292,neural24-1,and she found an old book in a in a chest.
4293,neural24-1,And lo.
4294,neural24-1,"and behold, she had a fairy godmother,."
4295,neural24-1,and the fairy godmother decided to help her go to the ball.
4296,neural24-1,"So she made her a dress,."
4297,neural24-1,"and then she made her a carriage and um a carriage driver and footman,."
4298,neural24-1,"and off she went to the ball with her beautiful dress and her glass slippers,."
4299,neural24-1,and she went to the ball.
4300,neural24-1,"and the prince fell madly in love with her at the ball,."
4301,neural24-1,and they danced.
4302,neural24-1,and they danced.
4303,neural24-1,"and they danced, and her stepsisters were very jealous and very angry."
4304,neural24-1,"And then the clock struck midnight,."
4305,neural24-1,"and oh no, Cinderella knew."
4306,neural24-1,that the fairy godmother had told her.
4307,neural24-1,"that at midnight, all the magic would vanish,."
4308,neural24-1,and she would go back to the way she was before.
4309,neural24-1,"So when the clock started striking midnight, she ran, she ran down the stairs."
4310,neural24-1,and ran away from the castle.
4311,neural24-1,"And on the way down, she'd lost one of her shoes on the steps,."
4312,neural24-1,"but she made it out,."
4313,neural24-1,and she made it home just in time.
4314,neural24-1,All she was left with was one slipper of her glass slipper to remind her of the night she'd had at the castle.
4315,neural24-1,"Well, the prince was determined."
4316,neural24-1,"that he was going to find his princess, the girl who wore the glass slipper."
4317,neural24-1,So they searched all over the countryside to find somebody whose foot would fit the glass slipper.
4318,neural24-1,"And they went to every house all over the countryside,."
4319,neural24-1,"and they finally got to Cinderella's house,."
4320,neural24-1,"and the stepsisters tried on the glass slipper,."
4321,neural24-1,but it didn't fit them.
4322,neural24-1,"So they started to leave, when all of a sudden Cinderella said, Here I am too."
4323,neural24-1,"And she tried on the glass slipper,."
4324,neural24-1,"and it fit,."
4325,neural24-1,and the prince knew he'd found his princess forever.
4326,neural24-1,The end.
4327,neural2-1,"OK, so the story begins with a young girl who lives with her father,."
4328,neural2-1,"as in many of the stories, the mother seems to be missing."
4329,neural2-1,and has died or something.
4330,neural2-1,"that So, so, uh, the father decides to remarry to a woman known in the story as the stepmother, wicked stepmother, who happens to have two daughters."
4331,neural2-1,"Uh, the stepsisters,."
4332,neural2-1,"and they move in,."
4333,neural2-1,"and after which point, um, I think I've forgotten the actual order of it,."
4334,neural2-1,but it seems.
4335,neural2-1,"like the something happens with the father And it's just the four of them,."
4336,neural2-1,"and uh the Cinderella doesn't really have anyone anymore, she just has the the Animals who are her friends,."
4337,neural2-1,because otherwise she's cleaning the house.
4338,neural2-1,"and taking care of the wicked stepmother and the wicked stepsisters,."
4339,neural2-1,"and they, uh, take care, they, they, they kind of are quite selfish."
4340,neural2-1,"and do whatever they want,."
4341,neural2-1,"and then, um, from there, oh, there's the castle, uh, far, far away,."
4342,neural2-1,"and one day they hear the the stepmother hears of this announcement she reads in the book about how, oh, yes, it looks."
4343,neural2-1,"like the prince is looking for someone to marry,."
4344,neural2-1,and they're going to have all of these young women come to the A castle for a ball.
4345,neural2-1,"So, Cinderella gets her lovely outfit made by herself and the animals."
4346,neural2-1,"No, no,."
4347,neural2-1,"that one was made by herself,."
4348,neural2-1,"and then, uh, she Go."
4349,neural2-1,"and Gets ready to go, and then the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters are ready to go,."
4350,neural2-1,"but then they say, oh no, you're not going to go,."
4351,neural2-1,"and they rip all of her clothes off,."
4352,neural2-1,and then she's crying and very upset.
4353,neural2-1,"and goes upstairs, and is in her room,."
4354,neural2-1,"and then the, uh, I think, uh, this part is a little bit hazy, um."
4355,neural2-1,"And maybe she goes out to a garden actually,."
4356,neural2-1,that 's when she meets Her fairy godmother.
4357,neural2-1,And it seems?
4358,neural2-1,"like she sings a song with bippity boppity boo, is that it?"
4359,neural2-1,or maybe another fairy tale.
4360,neural2-1,"Anyway, so she, she waves her wand."
4361,neural2-1,"and then her, her dog becomes a Does her dog become a horse or one of the carriage men, and then the mice."
4362,neural2-1,"The mice turn into something,."
4363,neural2-1,"and then there, there, the pumpkin becomes her carriage."
4364,neural2-1,"And then the rule was that after at midnight, you must be out of there."
4365,neural2-1,because the magic will wear off.
4366,neural2-1,"And she also gives her this beautiful white dress and a crown, and glass slippers,."
4367,neural2-1,"and then she goes off to the, to the castle or the palace,."
4368,neural2-1,"and , of course, the prince immediately falls in love with her."
4369,neural2-1,and wants to dance with her all night long.
4370,neural2-1,And the stepsisters.
4371,neural2-1,"and the stepmother do not even recognize her,."
4372,neural2-1,or everyone is watching.
4373,neural2-1,"and saying, who is that beautiful young woman, we don't know who she is."
4374,neural2-1,"And then, um, this clock starts to strike."
4375,neural2-1,"Midnight,."
4376,neural2-1,"and they, so she has to run out."
4377,neural2-1,and she leaves the prince alone.
4378,neural2-1,"And the, the one of the prince's helpers goes chasing after her,."
4379,neural2-1,"and she's running down the stairs very quickly, loses one of her glass slippers,."
4380,neural2-1,"and then Go charging away to get back to the house,."
4381,neural2-1,and then the uh magic wears off and she suddenly is just Cinderella once again.
4382,neural2-1,"So then when she gets back home, Um, I think."
4383,neural2-1,"as the story goes from the picture book, it seemed."
4384,neural2-1,like then uh they were trying to find who this beautiful young woman was and all they had was a glass slipper.
4385,neural2-1,"And From the picture book, it looked."
4386,neural2-1,"like there was a Um, oh yes, yes, yes."
4387,neural2-1,"In the picture book, there was a man with a glass slipper,."
4388,neural2-1,and it looked.
4389,neural2-1,"like he fell with a pillow,."
4390,neural2-1,and I'm kind of assuming from that storybook.
4391,neural2-1,that maybe he broke it.
4392,neural2-1,"But then I think Cinderella had the other glass slipper, so she must have come out with."
4393,neural2-1,But I remember from the story growing up that the older.
4394,neural2-1,"That the stepsisters tried to stick their big old feet in it,."
4395,neural2-1,"and they didn't fit,."
4396,neural2-1,"but I didn't see that in the in the storybook,."
4397,neural2-1,but I just remember.
4398,neural2-1,"And uh then, of course, they realized, oh, it must be her."
4399,neural2-1,"because her foot fits in the slipper,."
4400,neural2-1,"and then it all was solved,."
4401,neural2-1,and uh she went off to live with the prince.
4402,neural2-1,and lived happily ever after.
4403,neural19-1,"OK, so , Cinderella."
4404,neural19-1,was a maid.
4405,neural19-1,In the home of A woman and her two daughters.
4406,neural19-1,"Cinderella was very beautiful, but the woman and her daughters whom she served were ugly."
4407,neural19-1,"Um, Cinderella did things."
4408,neural19-1,like serving tea.
4409,neural19-1,And The women whom she served were not very appreciative.
4410,neural19-1,They were pretty snarky.
4411,neural19-1,"Um, She would sit by her window."
4412,neural19-1,"And from her room, she had a direct view to the castle in the distance,."
4413,neural19-1,and she often dreamed of a better life.
4414,neural19-1,She had a mystical way with animals.
4415,neural19-1,"although she was lonely, She had friends who were the animals in the barn."
4416,neural19-1,"And also, um, Some mice And some birds."
4417,neural19-1,"Bluebirds, specifically."
4418,neural19-1,"Uh, one day a proclamation came."
4419,neural19-1,and the prince was having a ball.
4420,neural19-1,And the woman.
4421,neural19-1,"and her two daughters were invited,."
4422,neural19-1,and Cinderella got very excited.
4423,neural19-1,and dreamed of the possibility.
4424,neural19-1,"of going, of course, she was not on the invitation list,."
4425,neural19-1,nor did she have the right clothes.
4426,neural19-1,"So , these magical mice got together."
4427,neural19-1,And they showed Cinderella a special magic chest.
4428,neural19-1,Where Wishes come true.
4429,neural19-1,And she wished for.
4430,neural19-1,A gown.
4431,neural19-1,"And a gown was made and a necklace,."
4432,neural19-1,"that actually she could go to the ball, but one."
4433,neural19-1,of these Young women ripped the necklace from her.
4434,neural19-1,And she was very discouraged.
4435,neural19-1,She felt.
4436,neural19-1,that she couldn't attend.
4437,neural19-1,And The mice intervened again.
4438,neural19-1,and brought her.
4439,neural19-1,A wise old Fairy godmother.
4440,neural19-1,"And the godmother said, I will make you a beautiful gown and slippers and a pumpkin coach."
4441,neural19-1,that you can attend the ball.
4442,neural19-1,"But there's only one stipulation, the, the, the spell will only last until the stroke of midnight."
4443,neural19-1,"So you, you must be back before the stroke of midnight."
4444,neural19-1,or the illusion will um be broken.
4445,neural19-1,So she went to the ball.
4446,neural19-1,"and she danced with the prince,."
4447,neural19-1,and they had a wonderful time.
4448,neural19-1,But she looked up.
4449,neural19-1,"and noticed it was almost midnight,."
4450,neural19-1,so she quickly ran away.
4451,neural19-1,But in the process.
4452,neural19-1,"of exiting, she left her, her glass slipper behind."
4453,neural19-1,But she managed to make it home with one slipper.
4454,neural19-1,Just.
4455,neural19-1,as the pumpkin coach was turning back into a pumpkin.
4456,neural19-1,So she resumed her work as a maid.
4457,neural19-1,"And a while later, Um, A messenger from the prince came."
4458,neural19-1,"and he was making calls to the different homes in the kingdom, trying to find someone."
4459,neural19-1,Who fit the glass slipper.
4460,neural19-1,"And when he knocked on the door, the older woman and her daughters were very excited."
4461,neural19-1,"They hoped that they could, could maybe be the match,."
4462,neural19-1,"but alas, their, their feet didn't work."
4463,neural19-1,But the slipper fits Cinderella perfectly.
4464,neural19-1,"So , Her, her destiny was revealed."
4465,neural19-1,She was this lovely princess.
4466,neural19-1,She reunited with the prince.
4467,neural19-1,And she was introduced.
4468,neural19-1,"Um, At home."
4469,neural19-1,She lived with her dog and the prince.
4470,neural19-1,"If the shoe fits, wear it."
4471,77-1,Looked at.
4472,77-1,OK.
4473,77-1,I will recap.
4474,77-1,OK.
4475,77-1,"So, there's this really sweet woman, young woman named Cinderella,."
4476,77-1,"and her mother died, we don't know when."
4477,77-1,"And her father remarried this real Karen, um, and her two daughters, which are referred to as her ugly stepsisters, That 's not very nice."
4478,77-1,"Um,."
4479,77-1,and her father introduces her to them.
4480,77-1,and she's trying to be really sweet.
4481,77-1,And the minute dad goes away.
4482,77-1,"Um, Stepmother."
4483,77-1,Let's Cinderella have it.
4484,77-1,"by telling her that basically she's their servant now, and everybody's really mean to her, but she's friends with all the animals and they're sort of comforting to her."
4485,77-1,"So, um, she's looking out, she looks out the window."
4486,77-1,"and she sees the Prince's castle in the distance, and it's all very Wistful."
4487,77-1,And then the stepmother.
4488,77-1,and the daughters receive an invitation to a ball.
4489,77-1,"because the prince's father said, you gotta pick a wife."
4490,77-1,Cause I'm not getting any younger.
4491,77-1,and you're gonna be king.
4492,77-1,and you gotta have a life.
4493,77-1,So they decide to have a ball.
4494,77-1,"and invite all the ladies of the land,."
4495,77-1,and Cinderella gets all excited.
4496,77-1,"and she has a, she makes a dress, I'm mixing up the book and the cartoon and the, but um."
4497,77-1,She's got these little mice.
4498,77-1,"that help her,."
4499,77-1,"and they're all fixing things up for her,."
4500,77-1,and she looks really pretty.
4501,77-1,And then she's all set to go to the ball with them.
4502,77-1,"and they say, uh nothing doing,."
4503,77-1,and they tear her dress.
4504,77-1,and drive off.
4505,77-1,and she's left there all sad.
4506,77-1,"And then her very godmother, Sally Gulla, Richard Kaula, would you like me to sing you this song?"
4507,77-1,Um.
4508,77-1,"And tells her, oh, you can go, I'll show you."
4509,77-1,So she waves her magic wand.
4510,77-1,and she's wearing this beautiful gown.
4511,77-1,"and the pumpkin turns into a golden coach, and the mice and the horse, you know, the mice and the whatever else they're turned into the, the horses and the coachman,."
4512,77-1,"and you can go to the ball,."
4513,77-1,but the only thing is you have to be home by the strike of midnight or everything.
4514,77-1,and everything turns back to where it was.
4515,77-1,So she goes to the ball.
4516,77-1,"and she dances with the prince,."
4517,77-1,"and he's totally enamored of her,."
4518,77-1,but then she hears the clock striking.
4519,77-1,"and so she runs away, um,."
4520,77-1,"but when she's running, she loses one of her glass slippers."
4521,77-1,"And so then they send out this decree all over the land they're gonna find who owns the slipper, so they go to all these houses."
4522,77-1,and they finally wind up at Cinderella's house.
4523,77-1,and they try the shoe on the to.
4524,77-1,"Unattractive Um, physiognomically challenged sisters,."
4525,77-1,"and they don't fit,."
4526,77-1,and then he finally tries it on Cinderella.
4527,77-1,"and it fits perfectly, and the prince is all happy and she's all happy."
4528,77-1,and they get married.
4529,77-1,and live happily ever after in the castle.
4530,77-1,The end.
4531,77-1,"As if, as if."
4532,225-1,"A little girl named um Cinderella,."
4533,225-1,"and she, her mother passed away,."
4534,225-1,"and she was living with her father, and he was lonely."
4535,225-1,and he married a woman who had two little girls that were about the same age as Cinderella.
4536,225-1,"so they all moved into the house together and Um, The stepmother was nice when the dad was there, but not so nice when he wasn't,."
4537,225-1,"and he passed away, so she."
4538,225-1,"and her daughters treated Cinderella like she was their servant, and she was lucky to be able to live with them."
4539,225-1,so she always had to clean.
4540,225-1,and cook.
4541,225-1,"and take care of them, do the laundry, and she was a very nice and pleasant girl and the animals were her friends,."
4542,225-1,"so she had mice and a dog,."
4543,225-1,but she didn't like the stepmother's cat very good.
4544,225-1,"that 's the way she grew up and she was still a lovely person, and she was kind and generous, and she was really pretty nice to the mean stepsisters and mom."
4545,225-1,"Then They lived in a land where there was um a beautiful castle and a king and a queen,."
4546,225-1,and they had a son.
4547,225-1,that they really felt.
4548,225-1,"like he needed to get married,."
4549,225-1,"so , They told him he needed to get married."
4550,225-1,"and he just kind of didn't,."
4551,225-1,"so they said, oh, we're gonna have a ball,."
4552,225-1,"and the prince is going to choose a wife,."
4553,225-1,so we're gonna have a ball.
4554,225-1,"and we're gonna invite all of the women, the girls in this in the country,."
4555,225-1,and they had some.
4556,225-1,"Um,."
4557,225-1,"So they sent out the invitations,."
4558,225-1,"and when Cinderella's stepmother got the invitation, she read it out loud."
4559,225-1,and the girls were so excited.
4560,225-1,"cause they were going to the ball,."
4561,225-1,and Cinderella was so excited.
4562,225-1,because it said that all the unmarried women.
4563,225-1,"could go to the ball,?"
4564,225-1,and she was so happy and the stepmother?
4565,225-1,and the stepsisters just laughed at her?
4566,225-1,"and said, Well, what would you wear?"
4567,225-1,You don't have anything to wear to a beautiful ball.
4568,225-1,so she was supposed to help the stepsisters.
4569,225-1,"and everybody get ready, and she was very sad,."
4570,225-1,but She had a chest downstairs.
4571,225-1,"that had her mother's old things in it,."
4572,225-1,and there was a dress in there.
4573,225-1,"that she thought she could kind of fix up that it would be beautiful, it would be a beautiful ball gown and um but her stepsisters."
4574,225-1,and her stepmother just kept yelling at her to do other things.
4575,225-1,so the mice and the birds.
4576,225-1,and all the Animal friends made it a beautiful dress.
4577,225-1,so she sent the sisters and the mom off to the ball.
4578,225-1,and she went downstairs.
4579,225-1,"Oh no, she didn't send them off yet."
4580,225-1,She went downstairs.
4581,225-1,"and there was a beautiful dress,."
4582,225-1,and she was so happy.
4583,225-1,and she put it on.
4584,225-1,and went upstairs to the telling her mom and her stepsisters.
4585,225-1,that she did have a beautiful gown.
4586,225-1,and she was going to go to the ball.
4587,225-1,and they tore her dress apart.
4588,225-1,"and told her no, she couldn't go to the ball."
4589,225-1,and she needed to just sit by the fire in the ashes.
4590,225-1,"So she was crying and she was very, very sad."
4591,225-1,and she wished she had.
4592,225-1,She wished she could go to the ball.
4593,225-1,"She was just saddened,."
4594,225-1,"so she was wishing she could go to the ball,."
4595,225-1,"and all of a sudden, A fairy godmother came,."
4596,225-1,and the fairy godmother said.
4597,225-1,"that she would give Cinderella her wish,."
4598,225-1,and she made.
4599,225-1,But took a pumpkin out of the yard and her friends that were the mice and the um The old horse.
4600,225-1,"and turned them into a pumpkin coach and a footman and a driver,."
4601,225-1,"and she created Cinderella, a beautiful dress and glass slippers."
4602,225-1,"And then Cinderella went to the ball in the pumpkin coach,."
4603,225-1,and when she got to the ball.
4604,225-1,"And she came down, probably do this."
4605,225-1,She Came down.
4606,225-1,and the prince saw her.
4607,225-1,and nobody recognized her.
4608,225-1,"Her sisters didn't recognize her, nobody recognized her,."
4609,225-1,but the prince was taken with her.
4610,225-1,"and they danced,."
4611,225-1,and they went.
4612,225-1,and talked.
4613,225-1,"and they were so happy,."
4614,225-1,"and the clock struck 12,."
4615,225-1,and Cinderella remembered.
4616,225-1,that the fairy godmother had said on the stroke of 12.
4617,225-1,Everything goes back to what it was.
4618,225-1,"You won't have your beautiful dress, you won't have your carriage,."
4619,225-1,so she ran off.
4620,225-1,"and ran through the ball and down the stairs,."
4621,225-1,"as she was running, one of her glass slippers fell off."
4622,225-1,And she didn't have time to go back.
4623,225-1,"and get it,."
4624,225-1,so she hurried up.
4625,225-1,"and jumped in the carriage,."
4626,225-1,"and they took off galloping,."
4627,225-1,and they went around the corner.
4628,225-1,"and it suck struck midnight,."
4629,225-1,so everything changed except.
4630,225-1,"for she had the glass slippers still on her foot,."
4631,225-1,so she tucked the glass slipper in her pocket.
4632,225-1,and she walked home and the princess um.
4633,225-1,"Servant is I don't know if he was, he was the prince's hand man."
4634,225-1,and he um took off trying to find her.
4635,225-1,and he ran down the stairs.
4636,225-1,And there was a slipper.
4637,225-1,So all they had to try.
4638,225-1,and find this mysterious girl was the slipper.
4639,225-1,"and the prince was just, he said, I just, I love her."
4640,225-1,"and I want to marry her,."
4641,225-1,and we have to find her.
4642,225-1,So they said for all the Maidens in the um in the Country.
4643,225-1,that they were going to come around.
4644,225-1,"and try this glass slipper,."
4645,225-1,"but Cinderella had extremely small, delicate feet,."
4646,225-1,so the slipper did not fit anyone.
4647,225-1,"And when they came to Cinderella's house, Cinderella's mom, evil stepmother, did not want her to be able to try it on,."
4648,225-1,"so she was trying on her sisters,."
4649,225-1,and it did not fit them.
4650,225-1,Even.
4651,225-1,"though they tried very hard to push it on, and then into the woods, because my daughter was Cinderella's mother,."
4652,225-1,"and she, in the real story, they try to cut off the heel."
4653,225-1,"and they cut off a troll trying to get him into the slipper,."
4654,225-1,but it did not fit.
4655,225-1,"And when Cinderella, he was gonna, Cinderella came into the room."
4656,225-1,and he's.
4657,225-1,"like , well, wait, we haven't tried it just."
4658,225-1,"as he was leaving, he says, we haven't tried it on Cinderella."
4659,225-1,so The stepmother got.
4660,225-1,"so anxious, she made the shoe fall."
4661,225-1,"and it broke,."
4662,225-1,and then the prince was so sad.
4663,225-1,"because he was never going to find his beautiful, his beautiful love, and Cinderella."
4664,225-1,Pulled the slipper out of her pocket.
4665,225-1,"and put it on her foot,."
4666,225-1,and she was immediately The fairy godmothers.
4667,225-1,"came and she was in her beautiful dress,."
4668,225-1,"and she got in the carriage with the prince,."
4669,225-1,and they were married.
4670,225-1,"And lived happily ever after, and she was even kind to her stepmother and stepsisters."
4671,225-1,"Kind of Sometimes they're in the laundry, sometimes she's kind to them,."
4672,225-1,but she married the prince.
4673,225-1,and they lived happily ever after.
4674,neural8-1,"Cinderella was a little farm girl whose dad actually did have somewhat of a title, but only."
4675,neural8-1,because he inherited it from her mother.
4676,neural8-1,"When her mother passed away, he remarried."
4677,neural8-1,"Oh, he was a merchant too."
4678,neural8-1,He remarried.
4679,neural8-1,and she brought the two stepdaughters.
4680,neural8-1,"One is Brunhilda,."
4681,neural8-1,and I can't remember the name of the other one.
4682,neural8-1,"So Giselle, who is Cinderella in the story, she chose her best to make friends."
4683,neural8-1,and to do everything that her stepmother.
4684,neural8-1,and her two sisters demand of her.
4685,neural8-1,"When she always dreams for a better time and a better life, she's very kind, does her work, and is subordinate,."
4686,neural8-1,"and Cut, use that word again."
4687,neural8-1,"So, It comes around."
4688,neural8-1,"as she's daydreaming at the castle, she hears tales of a ball,."
4689,neural8-1,"and sure enough, the invitation comes,."
4690,neural8-1,and all eligible females in the kingdom are to come to the ball.
4691,neural8-1,"and to meet the prince, where he will pick out his wife."
4692,neural8-1,So she goes.
4693,neural8-1,and decides to take her mother's dress.
4694,neural8-1,and convert it back into her own.
4695,neural8-1,"The little mice help as well,."
4696,neural8-1,and they have a wonderful little song that they sing.
4697,neural8-1,as they do this.
4698,neural8-1,"Now,."
4699,neural8-1,"Once the sisters find out, they are very displeased."
4700,neural8-1,So they tear apart her dress to shreds.
4701,neural8-1,"At this point, they leave for the ball,."
4702,neural8-1,and she runs to the garden to cry.
4703,neural8-1,Her fairy godmother shows up.
4704,neural8-1,"and says, Oh, no, dear, we will make this right."
4705,neural8-1,"The pumpkin, the lizards, the mice, they all turn into her chariot, her."
4706,neural8-1,and the carriageman she needs.
4707,neural8-1,The dress is fixed.
4708,neural8-1,"and turned into a beautiful gown,."
4709,neural8-1,and she gets to go to the ball.
4710,neural8-1,"At the ball, she meets the prince, and he is smitten,."
4711,neural8-1,but she does remember she has to be home by midnight.
4712,neural8-1,So she runs from the ball.
4713,neural8-1,"as he chases her,."
4714,neural8-1,"and she throws a shoe,."
4715,neural8-1,because the girl couldn't keep her shoes on.
4716,neural8-1,"As she's running home, it's almost midnight."
4717,neural8-1,"It does strike midnight, and all of a sudden, all of the magic is gone."
4718,neural8-1,and everything's returned to normal.
4719,neural8-1,She still had a wonderful evening.
4720,neural8-1,and remembers it as that.
4721,neural8-1,Saves the one shoe.
4722,neural8-1,and takes it up.
4723,neural8-1,and puts it in her trunk.
4724,neural8-1,"So, when the prince."
4725,neural8-1,"and his people start going around the kingdom to find the girl who fit the shoe, they go to every household."
4726,neural8-1,"In a deeper, darker story of Grimm's, the two sisters do terrible things."
4727,neural8-1,"One cuts off her toes, one cuts off her heels, so they fit in the shoe,."
4728,neural8-1,"but no, the birds avenge them."
4729,neural8-1,So Cinderella finally gets to try on the shoe.
4730,neural8-1,It fits.
4731,neural8-1,"She gets to marry the prince,."
4732,neural8-1,but she also forgives her evil stepmother and her sister.
4733,201-1,"So once upon a time, there was um a a girl who had a a doting father and mother and um Her name."
4734,201-1,Or I don't think her name was Cinderella to start with.
4735,201-1,"Anyhow, it turns out."
4736,201-1,that her mother passes away.
4737,201-1,"and after a time her father marries another woman who has two daughters,."
4738,201-1,and they all come to live with together in the same.
4739,201-1,Castle.
4740,201-1,"and uh it turns out that the, the stepmother is not kind to Cinderella and the stepsisters are, are very uh unkind as well."
4741,201-1,"And in a, in a while her father passes away."
4742,201-1,so she's left with the stepmother in charge.
4743,201-1,and the two stepsisters um are beginning to treat her as a maid rather than a than a sister.
4744,201-1,"And have her live in a different part of the house, the attic, and um she's in charge."
4745,201-1,"of cleaning the the cinders out of the fireplace,."
4746,201-1,so they start calling her Cinderella.
4747,201-1,"and her friends become the the little animals around the house, the rats and the mice and the the birds, and she's um friends with all of them, that 's who she ends up uh talking to."
4748,201-1,and befriending.
4749,201-1,"So , uh, there's, there's a king,."
4750,201-1,"and the king has a son that is eligible to be married,."
4751,201-1,and he decides.
4752,201-1,"that , uh, his son needs some help meeting some women,."
4753,201-1,so he decides there's going to be a ball for all the eligible maidens to come to the castle to meet the prince for the prince to pick a wife.
4754,201-1,And uh Cinderella gets very excited.
4755,201-1,because she too feels.
4756,201-1,like she's invited to this ball.
4757,201-1,And um starts dreaming about what sort.
4758,201-1,"of dress she might, might wear to the ball."
4759,201-1,And um the stepsisters get wind of the fact.
4760,201-1,that she thinks.
4761,201-1,that she should come.
4762,201-1,"and they end up uh locking her up in a, in a room."
4763,201-1,"And this was after the mice and ,."
4764,201-1,"and they had all worked together to, to refashion a dress."
4765,201-1,"that Cinderella had found um in her belongings, maybe belonged to her mother."
4766,201-1,as I recall.
4767,201-1,"And um it was, it was very beautiful,."
4768,201-1,but when she came down the stepsister saw.
4769,201-1,"that she was dressed and ready to go to the ball, they ripped the necklace off of her neck."
4770,201-1,and tore her dress and um.
4771,201-1,and made it such.
4772,201-1,that she couldn't couldn't go to the ball.
4773,201-1,So they left for the ball.
4774,201-1,and then um Cinderella's very godmother came.
4775,201-1,"and saw that she was in distress and uh was able to create uh Uh, carriage and horses out of the the different critters around the pumpkin in the in the backyard."
4776,201-1,"and the, the, I think it was lizards or something."
4777,201-1,"that got turned into horses,."
4778,201-1,and then um she also created a beautiful gown.
4779,201-1,"for her to wear, sent her off to the ball, but with instructions."
4780,201-1,that by midnight she needed to come back home.
4781,201-1,because the spell would be broken.
4782,201-1,that had created her dress and the beautiful.
4783,201-1,"Uh, carriage."
4784,201-1,that she was to ride in and um.
4785,201-1,so she went off to the ball.
4786,201-1,and she had also fitted her with glass slippers.
4787,201-1,"That was the, the finishing touch to her, her uh dress and um one of the glass slippers."
4788,201-1,of course she meets the prince.
4789,201-1,The prince thinks that she's lovely.
4790,201-1,and they dance.
4791,201-1,"and have a great time,."
4792,201-1,but then the clock starts striking 12.
4793,201-1,And uh she realizes she has to get out of there.
4794,201-1,"or she's gonna turn back into her, her ragged clothes and um."
4795,201-1,so she dashes off and in the process.
4796,201-1,"of going down the stairs, loses one of her shoes,."
4797,201-1,and manages to get in the carriage.
4798,201-1,and get get far enough away that um they're away from the castle.
4799,201-1,"and then everything turns back into a pumpkin and lizards and mice and ,."
4800,201-1,and um they make their way back to the house.
4801,201-1,"And the, when the stepsisters."
4802,201-1,"and the stepmother get back home, they realize."
4803,201-1,that uh um somehow she has managed to get to the ball.
4804,201-1,"and they um Uh, when they, the call goes out."
4805,201-1,that they're gonna come around.
4806,201-1,"and try on the glass slipper, they make sure."
4807,201-1,that she's locked up in her upstairs in her attic room and not able to come down to try on the glass slipper in hopes that when one.
4808,201-1,of the stepsisters can get it on.
4809,201-1,And then uh the mice saved the day.
4810,201-1,and bring her the key to come out.
4811,201-1,and get the glass slipper tried on.
4812,201-1,and it fits.
4813,201-1,and she goes to live with the prince happily ever after the end.
4814,67-1,"It was Um, I think girl, I guess for young lady."
4815,67-1,Whose mother died.
4816,67-1,and the father went away.
4817,67-1,"and she was living with her step, a new stepmother."
4818,67-1,And the the stepsisters.
4819,67-1,"Um, she was a beautiful lady."
4820,67-1,"And the one day,."
4821,67-1,but they didn't treat her well.
4822,67-1,They just had to do all the housework and everything.
4823,67-1,and they didn't think much of her.
4824,67-1,"So one day the um the prince, there was announced."
4825,67-1,that the prince is gonna have a ball.
4826,67-1,that I'm seeing so many versions of this story.
4827,67-1,"I'll say this one,."
4828,67-1,so they called he's gonna have a ball.
4829,67-1,and he was looking for his true love.
4830,67-1,so everyone was very excited.
4831,67-1,The whole village was invited to the ball.
4832,67-1,"so the sister, his stepsisters were really excited."
4833,67-1,because they thought they were married.
4834,67-1,One of them was married to Prince.
4835,67-1,and they will live happily ever after.
4836,67-1,"However, Cinderella wants to go to the ball too,."
4837,67-1,"but they, they laughed at her."
4838,67-1,"and they said, you can't go."
4839,67-1,because you don't have anything to wear and no one would be interested in you.
4840,67-1,You'll stay here.
4841,67-1,And then Cinderella was sad.
4842,67-1,"But then the fairy, she had a fairy godmother."
4843,67-1,that appeared.
4844,67-1,and told her.
4845,67-1,"That you know, I will, I will make, you can have a wish, you will go to the ball,."
4846,67-1,"but the furry godmother turned, I can't remember."
4847,67-1,"because the coach, I think the coach was a pumpkin."
4848,67-1,And the mice or the horses.
4849,67-1,"And she gave she gave, made her a beautiful gown."
4850,67-1,But she can go to the ball.
4851,67-1,But she had to be back home by midnight.
4852,67-1,or everything would change back to a pumpkin and a mice.
4853,67-1,so she went to the ball and she was the most beautiful woman there.
4854,67-1,"When the prince saw her, he was very attracted to her,."
4855,67-1,so they started dancing.
4856,67-1,and they were just having a wonderful time.
4857,67-1,and everyone wanted to know who this woman was.
4858,67-1,"But the clock struck, the clock was getting ready to strike 12."
4859,67-1,"and she had to leave suddenly,."
4860,67-1,so she ran out to the carriage.
4861,67-1,"and she was,."
4862,67-1,"as she was running down the steps, she lost her slipper, her scoop."
4863,67-1,so she just left.
4864,67-1,and got in the carriage.
4865,67-1,"and she wrote, she's going back home."
4866,67-1,And um it was funny.
4867,67-1,because every everything started turning back to pump in the mice.
4868,67-1,so she made it home.
4869,67-1,and the prince found his shoe on a step.
4870,67-1,"and he said, well, let me just Um, who does this belong to."
4871,67-1,because I love her.
4872,67-1,I want to marry her.
4873,67-1,We have to find her.
4874,67-1,"So he did a search of the village, everyone's house to find."
4875,67-1,What woman.
4876,67-1,that she would sit.
4877,67-1,so he came to the house where Cinderella lives.
4878,67-1,And the sisters were really trying to make that shoe fit?
4879,67-1,"because they wanted this royalty,?"
4880,67-1,but it didn't fit?
4881,67-1,"and someone said, well, is there anyone else here in the house?"
4882,67-1,"And the evil stepmother said, no, well, it's just, it wouldn't be her."
4883,67-1,"So he said, bring her out."
4884,67-1,"And when she put the slipper on, it fit her so he was excited."
4885,67-1,and they got married.
4886,67-1,and live happily ever after.
4887,13-1,was a much beloved only daughter.
4888,13-1,"Um,."
4889,13-1,and her father loved her more than anything.
4890,13-1,Her mother had passed away.
4891,13-1,"And over time, father met another woman."
4892,13-1,and met met another woman.
4893,13-1,"and married her,."
4894,13-1,"and this woman came along with two daughters of her own, who I think were slightly older than Cinderella."
4895,13-1,"Um, Her dad always held her high,."
4896,13-1,"but he treated everyone else in the family well,."
4897,13-1,"but unfortunately, dad passed away."
4898,13-1,And the new stepmother.
4899,13-1,didn't have any interest in Cinderella at all.
4900,13-1,"She cared about her two daughters, the money."
4901,13-1,"that was left,."
4902,13-1,and getting her two daughters married off.
4903,13-1,"They were kind of ugly daughters actually, or at least they were very vain,."
4904,13-1,and uh they had to have the best of everything.
4905,13-1,They had to have new clothes.
4906,13-1,and they fought with each other and um.
4907,13-1,but mother was so indulgent with them.
4908,13-1,that they only got worse.
4909,13-1,They were not good people.
4910,13-1,"In the meantime, She reduced Cinderella."
4911,13-1,"and she said, you know, you don't count anymore."
4912,13-1,"Your father is not here anymore, and you're not part of this family, really,."
4913,13-1,but I'm being so magnanimous.
4914,13-1,"that I will allow you to stay here,."
4915,13-1,but you're going to have to be a servant in this house.
4916,13-1,"No, you will not be in your own room anymore."
4917,13-1,"You're going to be in this little attic room,."
4918,13-1,and you're going to have to do chores all the time.
4919,13-1,"Well, over time, Cinderella, which is what they started calling her."
4920,13-1,because she had to sweep up the cinders for the for the uh fireplace.
4921,13-1,"and all of this other thing, really was reduced that no matter how much she tried."
4922,13-1,"and she, she seemed To be as joyful."
4923,13-1,as she could as uh patient as respectful.
4924,13-1,as she could to her stepmother and her sister.
4925,13-1,"She was, she was an object of ridicule constantly."
4926,13-1,Came a time when uh the word went out through the village.
4927,13-1,that the king was having a ball that the much eligible prince uh would be the the ball would be in his honor.
4928,13-1,"so all the young women in the kingdom who were single, were all."
4929,13-1,about themselves trying to get to the ball.
4930,13-1,because they wanted to win his hand.
4931,13-1,"Well, Cinderella's sisters, stepsisters,."
4932,13-1,"and stepmother could see nothing except how this was going to work in their favor,."
4933,13-1,and she spared no expense and no time.
4934,13-1,and getting them the most actually gaudy clothes.
4935,13-1,They went over the top.
4936,13-1,"They were not, they were not right for a prince,."
4937,13-1,but they couldn't see.
4938,13-1,that Cinderella had a dress.
4939,13-1,Cinderella had a dress left from when her dad was still alive.
4940,13-1,that she loved.
4941,13-1,"and her stepmother would not let her wear it, would not let her wear it."
4942,13-1,"And she had no place to go anyway,."
4943,13-1,"and she was told, you know, we're gonna go to this ball,."
4944,13-1,but you have to stay here.
4945,13-1,and take care of the place.
4946,13-1,Cinderella.
4947,13-1,was so heartbroken.
4948,13-1,"and she kept thinking if only,."
4949,13-1,"if only I could go to this ball,."
4950,13-1,if only I could meet people.
4951,13-1,"if I could just wear my, my dress once."
4952,13-1,and get out of this awful chores in this basement in this attic.
4953,13-1,And puff appeared um.
4954,13-1,"Oh, I'm trying to think who appeared."
4955,13-1,"Uh, her fairy godmother came like out of a spark,."
4956,13-1,"and the fairy godmother, you know, Cinderella looked at her with wide eyes."
4957,13-1,"and she said, you are a dear young woman and I am here to help you."
4958,13-1,"And you need to go to the ball,."
4959,13-1,"and no, I can't go to the ball."
4960,13-1,I don't have the right clothes.
4961,13-1,"I, I have no way to get there."
4962,13-1,"And over the course of the next few minutes,."
4963,13-1,"that very magical fairy godmother said, You shall have a coach, and the coach will be this pumpkin."
4964,13-1,"So , what do you mean?"
4965,13-1,"And wha, the, the coach can become a uh the pumpkin becomes a coach with footmen and everything with another uh."
4966,13-1,Waft of her wand.

4968,13-1,"that just shows her beauty to know to no end,."
4969,13-1,and she has a beautiful hairdo.
4970,13-1,She is ready for the ball and a pair of beautiful glass slippers.
4971,13-1,"Um, Little birds fly around her in Disney's version, and uh."
4972,13-1,and they seem to understand her.
4973,13-1,"and she understands them and all of a sudden it's a magical world in which Cinderella, everything is going right for her."
4974,13-1,"Um,."
4975,13-1,"So , when the the very godmother says, yes, you have all of this now,."
4976,13-1,but you need to know it only lasts until midnight.
4977,13-1,"Oh, the mice are the horses for the coach,."
4978,13-1,and um I think that 's all of the things.
4979,13-1,"that go together there,."
4980,13-1,and she uh says.
4981,13-1,"that uh you must remember, you must be home."
4982,13-1,"By 12,."
4983,13-1,"if you're not, this coach will become a pumpkin,."

4992,13-1,"What, what happened?"
4993,13-1,"How did, you know, whatever,."
4994,13-1,but they don't pay any attention.
4995,13-1,"They're too busy trying to show themselves off, you know, overflowing bosoms in people's faces and such to the prince."
4996,13-1,"and try to get their interest,."
4997,13-1,but the prince has spied Cinderella.
4998,13-1,"And he thinks she's the most beautiful woman there,."
4999,13-1,and he asks her to dance.
5000,13-1,"And they dance,."
5001,13-1,and they dance all night.
5002,13-1,And she's having such a good time.
5003,13-1,that the time has passed so quickly.
5004,13-1,that she doesn't even remember.
5005,13-1,"about not thinking at all, not remember,."
5006,13-1,but she hasn't thought at all about what time it is.
5007,13-1,and what happens at midnight when she hears the clock start to strike for midnight.
5008,13-1,And she runs from the prince.
5009,13-1,and she runs down the stairs.
5010,13-1,She runs so quickly.
5011,13-1,"that one of her slippers falls off,."
5012,13-1,"and she runs,."
5013,13-1,"and she runs,."
5014,13-1,and she gets in the coach.
5015,13-1,and they madly run home just in time.
5016,13-1,that she gets home without everything falling apart.
5017,13-1,And then when the sisters.
5018,13-1,"and the the stepmother come home, they're very angry, but she's back where she is."
5019,13-1,"and they, you know, They, they, they tell her she has to stay in her place."
5020,13-1,and don't ever do that sort of thing again.
5021,13-1,"But meanwhile, back at the palace, the prince says, I have to find this young woman."
5022,13-1,"I don't know anything about her, but I'm in love with her."
5023,13-1,and I want to marry her.
5024,13-1,I want her to be my princess.
5025,13-1,"And after all, that 's what the ball was for anyway, was to find a wife."
5026,13-1,He's decided it should be Cinderella.
5027,13-1,But he has no knowledge of who she is or what she is.
5028,13-1,All he has is her tiny dainty glass slipper.
5029,13-1,so he sets out.
5030,13-1,and he goes all over the kingdom.
5031,13-1,as all the single women line up forever.
5032,13-1,and ever trying to stuff their feet into this glass slipper.
5033,13-1,"Of course, their feet are all too big or too wide."
5034,13-1,"or too whatever, they do not fit."
5035,13-1,"And when they get to Cinderella's house, the two stepsisters literally almost kill each other trying to Make sure."
5036,13-1,"that he sees that they're the ones,."
5037,13-1,"but then he spies Cinderella, who's busy doing her chores,."
5038,13-1,"and he says, I want you to try on this slipper."
5039,13-1,And she's very demure.
5040,13-1,and she sort of backs off and everything.
5041,13-1,"and uh he said, no, come here."
5042,13-1,and try to slip on and of course it is a perfect fit.
5043,13-1,"So he grabs her up in his arms, puts him, puts her in front of him on his beautiful white charger."
5044,13-1,and takes her to the palace where plans are made for the wedding.
5045,13-1,The stepmother is really ticked off.
5046,13-1,"and the sisters are ticked off, but now, of course, Cinderella."
5047,13-1,"as she becomes the princess, is uh Has risen in society far above the stepmother and the stepsisters,."
5048,13-1,"so they fall over themselves to, oh yes, of course, we did everything for her."
5049,13-1,"and she owes everything to us,."
5050,13-1,"but we know that the prince and Cinderella will be happy forever after, and the greedy stepmother."
5051,13-1,and stepsisters will just have to live with their own reality.
5052,13-1,The end.
5053,wright05a,"Cinderella had a very happy home,."
5054,wright05a,but her mother died.
5055,wright05a,"After a bit, her father remarried."
5056,wright05a,Stepmother had two very unattractive.
5057,wright05a,Blessed daughters.
5058,wright05a,and they made Cinderella's life.
5059,wright05a,"Uh,."
5060,wright05a,"as they grew, Cinderella became."
5061,wright05a,A housemaid.
5062,wright05a,and took care of her.
5063,wright05a,Girls did what they wanted.
5064,wright05a,Fetch whatever they.
5065,wright05a,"And in the meantime, the young prince had grown."
5066,wright05a,Father was disturbed.
5067,wright05a,because he had the.
5068,wright05a,Princess.
5069,wright05a,"that he wanted to marry,."
5070,wright05a,so he decided to have a ball.
5071,wright05a,birthday.
5072,wright05a,And he sent out invitations.
5073,wright05a,To fall.
5074,wright05a,So the stepsisters were just thrilled.
5075,wright05a,"because they got an invitation,."
5076,wright05a,so they got their new dresses.
5077,wright05a,and had Cinderella polish.
5078,wright05a,and shine everything.
5079,wright05a,Just.
5080,wright05a,"because the invitation went to everyone, Cinderella decided she."
5081,wright05a,Address to go to.
5082,wright05a,All the animals.
5083,wright05a,that help.
5084,wright05a,And she sewed this lovely.
5085,wright05a,It was a simple dress but very great.
5086,wright05a,And she When the time came for them all to dress.
5087,wright05a,"and go to the ball,."
5088,wright05a,"while she helped the stepsisters get dressed,."
5089,wright05a,and then she went.
5090,wright05a,Put on Little pink dress.
5091,wright05a,"And when she came down the stepsister says, oh, they couldn't, she could not go with them."
5092,wright05a,"That 's absolutely, because she was nothing but a chambermaid."
5093,wright05a,so they actually tore her dress.
5094,wright05a,so she couldn't.
5095,wright05a,They got in the coach and left.
5096,wright05a,"and then said, Really The sisters were."
5097,wright05a,so mean to.
5098,wright05a,"All of a sudden, We're?"
5099,wright05a,"And she said, Fix you a dress that is the prettiest one in the land, which she, Was just gorgeous?"
5100,wright05a,and then Cinderella hair was fixed?
5101,wright05a,"and she just looked beautiful,?"
5102,wright05a,"and she said, how am I going to get there?"
5103,wright05a,And Very sick.
5104,wright05a,Bring me the pumpkin.
5105,wright05a,Nice.
5106,wright05a,A a coach out of.
5107,wright05a,Horses.
5108,wright05a,"Mice became horses,."
5109,wright05a,"so they carried her to the, To the ball when she entered, the prince was just dazzled by her."
5110,wright05a,He asked her to dance.
5111,wright05a,and they danced again.
5112,wright05a,And they did It struck midnight.
5113,wright05a,And She knew.
5114,wright05a,that she had to be back home.
5115,wright05a,because she promised the fairy godmother.
5116,wright05a,"that she would leave, I assumed."
5117,wright05a,Before mid.
5118,wright05a,So she dashed out.
5119,wright05a,Fall.
5120,wright05a,and in a hurry she lost one of her.
5121,wright05a,Glass slippers.
5122,wright05a,And got into Coach Took off.
5123,wright05a,"But unfortunately, Like 12."
5124,wright05a,"Nothing but a pumpkin and mice,."
5125,wright05a,"and she had lost her pretty dress,."
5126,wright05a,but she still had one glass slipper.
5127,wright05a,so she put that in her pocket.
5128,wright05a,"I think she had,."
5129,wright05a,but she didn't think she'd ever.
5130,wright05a,See the prince again.
5131,wright05a,or have this.
5132,wright05a,Yeah.
5133,wright05a,The sisters came home.
5134,wright05a,About this strange young woman was there.
5135,wright05a,that she took up all the time.
5136,wright05a,and the prince was.
5137,wright05a,so taken with her.
5138,wright05a,and they wondered who she was.
5139,wright05a,How come he was.
5140,wright05a,so taken with her.
5141,wright05a,Danced with him more than once.
5142,wright05a,And then the prince was just so distraught.
5143,wright05a,that he sent out a search party trying to find the young woman.
5144,wright05a,Belonged to the glass slipper which he found.
5145,wright05a,Chasing.
5146,wright05a,And we finally came to their house.
5147,wright05a,On this slipper.
5148,wright05a,"Young women, so the stuff."
5149,wright05a,"that we have,."
5150,wright05a,And They tried to push their Big feet into the slips.
5151,wright05a,The last slipper it wouldn't work.
5152,wright05a,I said that isn't there.
5153,wright05a,You have a moment here.
5154,wright05a,"That She said, yes, I'm here, even."
5155,wright05a,"though the stepmother said, no, no, no."
5156,wright05a,"said You must try it on,."
5157,wright05a,so she pulled out.
5158,wright05a,year.
5159,wright05a,Matches.
5160,wright05a,and he slipped the other shoe on.
5161,wright05a,Both of it beautifully.
5162,wright05a,This.
5163,wright05a,Cinderella married the prince.
5164,wright11a,Yeah.
5165,wright11a,think.
5166,wright11a,so OK.
5167,wright11a,And Cinderella was a child.
5168,wright11a,Her father had remarried.
5169,wright11a,"after her mother had passed away, and her new stepmother."
5170,wright11a,and 2 stepsisters moved in with them.
5171,wright11a,"As they got older, the stepsisters became meaner and meaner to Cinderella, making her do all the household chores."
5172,wright11a,And doing everything for them.
5173,wright11a,"Cinderella had no life of her own,."
5174,wright11a,"so spent a lot of time with all the uh farm animals, telling them stories of how she would like to meet Prince Charming."
5175,wright11a,Then one day it was announced.
5176,wright11a,that Prince Charming would be holding a ball to try to find a wife.
5177,wright11a,"So Cinderella got excited, excited, saying she would go to the ball."
5178,wright11a,and make a beautiful dress.
5179,wright11a,and meet Prince Charming.
5180,wright11a,"At the same time, the stepsisters were getting ready for the ball also, talking of how they would marry Prince Charming."
5181,wright11a,"and live, live a wonderful life with him too."
5182,wright11a,"So the night of the ball, Cinderella puts on the beautiful pink dress she had made."
5183,wright11a,Put on some jewelry?
5184,wright11a,and did her hair?
5185,wright11a,"and was walking out when the stepsisters said, where do you think you're going?"
5186,wright11a,"And Cinderella says, I'm going to the ball and they."
5187,wright11a,Ripped her dress to pieces.
5188,wright11a,and tore her jewelry off.
5189,wright11a,and messed up her hair.
5190,wright11a,"so she couldn't go to the ball,."
5191,wright11a,as they laughed.
5192,wright11a,and walked out the door.
5193,wright11a,and headed to the ball without her.
5194,wright11a,Cinderella was so upset.
5195,wright11a,"That she couldn't go to the ball any longer,."
5196,wright11a,and she sat outside.
5197,wright11a,and cried.
5198,wright11a,All of a sudden.
5199,wright11a,A fairy godmother came along?
5200,wright11a,"and said, what are you crying?"
5201,wright11a,"And she said, I can no longer go to the ball."
5202,wright11a,My dress is all torn.
5203,wright11a,And I have nothing else to wear.
5204,wright11a,"And the fairy godmother said, oh dear, let me take care of for you."
5205,wright11a,"And with a wave of her wand, she gave Cinderella a beautiful dress, and her hair was all in a beautiful hairdo."
5206,wright11a,"And she has some beautiful glass slippers,?"
5207,wright11a,"and Cinderella said, thank you, fairy godmother,?"
5208,wright11a,but now how will I get there?
5209,wright11a,"so the fairy godmother says, well, here's a coach."
5210,wright11a,"for you to take you to the ball,."
5211,wright11a,but you have to leave at midnight.
5212,wright11a,or it'll turn into a pumpkin.
5213,wright11a,"So Cinderella says, oh no problem."
5214,wright11a,I'll be home by midnight.
5215,wright11a,Thank you so much.
5216,wright11a,"So off to the ball, she goes and her In her carriage and her beautiful dress and her glass slippers."
5217,wright11a,Cinderella gets to the ball.
5218,wright11a,And is in awe of how beautiful it is.
5219,wright11a,and she sees Prince Charming.
5220,wright11a,and Prince Charming sees her immediately.
5221,wright11a,and comes over to her.
5222,wright11a,and ask her to dance.
5223,wright11a,"so they, they dance for hours."
5224,wright11a,and then Cinderella hears the clock strike midnight and she gets worried.
5225,wright11a,"and says, oh no, I have to leave."
5226,wright11a,And she immediately runs out the door.
5227,wright11a,"as she's running to the, to the carriage, she loses one of her slippers."
5228,wright11a,and doesn't have time to go grab it.
5229,wright11a,So she jumps in the carriage.
5230,wright11a,and the carriage takes her off.
5231,wright11a,"Off into the distance, leaving Prince Charming to wonder who the beautiful woman was."
5232,wright11a,"So when Cinderella's home, all she can dream about is her night at the ball."
5233,wright11a,And how wonderful it was.
5234,wright11a,"And in the meantime, Prince Charming is wondering who this beautiful woman was."
5235,wright11a,and how he's going to find her.
5236,wright11a,And realizes he can take the glass slipper.
5237,wright11a,"and find, find out who it fits, that will be his girl."
5238,wright11a,"So he sends his assistant off to the village to try the shoes on, on all the women to see."
5239,wright11a,if he can find her for him.
5240,wright11a,"When he gets to um Cinderella's house, the stepsisters had heard the story of them coming to try to slipper on all the women."
5241,wright11a,So they're convinced.
5242,wright11a,"that they will fit, one of them will fit into the slipper."
5243,wright11a,When the man comes into the house.
5244,wright11a,"and the shoe doesn't fit the two stepsisters, he sees Cinderella."
5245,wright11a,"and says, You haven't tried the shoe on yet."
5246,wright11a,"And the stepmother says, oh,."
5247,wright11a,that won't fit her anyhow.
5248,wright11a,"And the man says, well, we have to at least try."
5249,wright11a,"So he walks over to her with a slipper on the pillow,."
5250,wright11a,"as he's walking over, the stepmother tries to trip him."
5251,wright11a,"And the shoe flies in the air,."
5252,wright11a,and Cinderella's foot sticking out.
5253,wright11a,and it slides right onto her foot.
5254,wright11a,and fits perfectly.
5255,wright11a,that 's when they realized that Cinderella is the woman.
5256,wright11a,that Prince Charming is looking.
5257,wright11a,And they take her to the castle.
5258,wright11a,and they live happily ever.
5259,228-1,"Um, there was a family, a man."
5260,228-1,"and a woman who had a daughter, um, the woman, um, the mother passed away, the young daughter, um,."
5261,228-1,"and young daughter was named Cinder Cinderella, um."
5262,228-1,The man decided.
5263,228-1,"that he needed to remarry, so he remarried a woman who had two daughters also, so both, both apparently were widowers."
5264,228-1,"Um, the two older daughters, I forgot what their names were, um, were, um, a little bit older than Cinderella,."
5265,228-1,and they did not like her because um she was step.
5266,228-1,"Um, so they made her work."
5267,228-1,They made her do everything.
5268,228-1,"They made her sweet, they made her clean out, they made her cook, they made her, um, Uh, make their beds, they made her, um,."
5269,228-1,and she wasn't included in any anything else.
5270,228-1,"The father had to go on several trips, so he probably didn't know what was going on."
5271,228-1,They did.
5272,228-1,"Um, So, uh, there was also in."
5273,228-1,"that kingdom, the king had a son who needed to get married,."
5274,228-1,"and the son didn't want to get married,."
5275,228-1,but he uh was gonna have a ball for him.
5276,228-1,and uh bring all of the the the maidens from around the community could attend the ball.
5277,228-1,and he could look over who he.
5278,228-1,if there was somebody to marry.
5279,228-1,"Um, they went to this house, uh, they, uh, the court went to the house, made an announcement."
5280,228-1,"that they were invited to this ball, and so the two oldest girls, uh, uh, the two girls of the woman."
5281,228-1,"Uh, got ready to go,."
5282,228-1,and they told Cinderella.
5283,228-1,"that she could not go to the ball,."
5284,228-1,"and she helped make all of their stuff, made them beautiful."
5285,228-1,"She, I think she went through her mother's stuff."
5286,228-1,"and tried to find some stuff there,."
5287,228-1,but they wouldn't let her have anything to do with her original mother.
5288,228-1,Stuff.
5289,228-1,and they told her she couldn't go.
5290,228-1,and they left to go to the ball and then a fairy godmother I guess comes.
5291,228-1,and um she helps make her beautiful.
5292,228-1,"She along with a couple of mice according to Walt Disney, um."
5293,228-1,"And then they gave her, uh, then they gave her, uh, they took a pumpkin."
5294,228-1,"and turned it into a coach,."
5295,228-1,but she had to be back by midnight.
5296,228-1,"So she goes to the ball, she's very beautiful,."
5297,228-1,and the prince uh uh is infatuated with her.
5298,228-1,"and they dance the night away, and it's the stroke of midnight."
5299,228-1,"She runs away, she leaves a glass slipper."
5300,228-1,And um then it turns into herself.
5301,228-1,"as she's leading the ball, of course, nobody sees that , um."
5302,228-1,And then when they um then then I guess they have the slipper.
5303,228-1,and the court wants to find out who whose foot can fit in the slipper.
5304,228-1,because he wants to know who Cinderella was.
5305,228-1,because he didn't find out her name or her address or email address or any of that kind of stuff.
5306,228-1,"So, um, they go to all the neighborhoods."
5307,228-1,and the mother makes sure the girls can try to fit on the slipper.
5308,228-1,"Um, but they can't, their feet are big, and Cinderella's feet are very small, and by happenstance, she is there and able to spit on the slipper,."
5309,228-1,"and they recognize that she is the one that was at the ball,."
5310,228-1,"and apparently the prince, uh, she's introduced to the prince again."
5311,228-1,and they follow.
5312,87-1,Cinderella ended up with uh her father.
5313,87-1,"because her mother died, um,."
5314,87-1,and he needed someone to take care of her.
5315,87-1,because he probably felt with all his work or business uh.
5316,87-1,"or traveling, um,."
5317,87-1,that he needed someone uh available to help raise her.
5318,87-1,"So he, and I'm not sure what what the relative is."
5319,87-1,But she goes to live with this.
5320,87-1,"Aunt I'll say,."
5321,87-1,and um the aunt has two daughters.
5322,87-1,And they accept her in.
5323,87-1,"Um, the daughters are not very kind, um."
5324,87-1,"They treat her more as a maid, uh, having her do jobs and things, um."
5325,87-1,"They, um, I'm sure tease her."
5326,87-1,"And Um, the ant."
5327,87-1,"Receives word that the Uh, King."
5328,87-1,and queen are going to have a ball.
5329,87-1,"For their son, the prince."
5330,87-1,I could be making up stuff that isn't even in the store.
5331,87-1,That 's OK um.
5332,87-1,"Um,."
5333,87-1,"and so they received this invitation and they're all excited,."
5334,87-1,"and they're probably thinking about what are they going to wear, um,."
5335,87-1,"and Cinderella hears about this, and she's probably very excited too, thinking."
5336,87-1,"that she can go,."
5337,87-1,but they don't allow her to go.
5338,87-1,"She has to stay home, do the chores."
5339,87-1,So they get ready.
5340,87-1,"and um they go and they're off at the at the ball, um they're trying to find uh someone."
5341,87-1,"that he can marry,."
5342,87-1,and the sisters are hoping.
5343,87-1,that he will choose.
5344,87-1,One of them.
5345,87-1,"So in the meantime, she is at home, um, very sad doing her chores."
5346,87-1,Wishing.
5347,87-1,"that she could go and Um, a fairy godmother."
5348,87-1,Appears her fairy godmother.
5349,87-1,And the very godmother.
5350,87-1,"Uh, gives her the ability to go."
5351,87-1,by doing magic with her wand.
5352,87-1,And uh she has a beautiful gown.
5353,87-1,She dresses her in this uh beautiful.
5354,87-1,A full length gown?
5355,87-1,and The only problem is how is she going to get there?
5356,87-1,So the very godmother.
5357,87-1,Takes uh uh.
5358,87-1,Get some mice.
5359,87-1,And turns the mice into horses.
5360,87-1,and leave the pumpkin into a carriage.
5361,87-1,And so that 's how Cinderella is going to get to the ball.
5362,87-1,"So she's dressed, she's off in the in the coach, the carriage,."
5363,87-1,and they arrive at the at the ball.
5364,87-1,And Cinderella steps out.
5365,87-1,and she goes in the castle.
5366,87-1,And the prince.
5367,87-1,"After probably dancing with several different women, sees her."
5368,87-1,And I think he's mesmerized.
5369,87-1,"by her captivated,."
5370,87-1,and he starts to dance with her.
5371,87-1,And they probably enjoy conversation.
5372,87-1,They talk.
5373,87-1,"and He's starting to be very interested in her,."
5374,87-1,but The clock strikes 12.
5375,87-1,because the Fairy godmother told Cinderella.
5376,87-1,that at 12 o'clock she had to leave the ball.
5377,87-1,And get home.
5378,87-1,So when Cinderella heard.
5379,87-1,that chiming of the clock.
5380,87-1,"and it struck 12, she knew she had to leave and in the process."
5381,87-1,"of leaving, One."
5382,87-1,of her slippers fell off.
5383,87-1,And so she dashes out.
5384,87-1,"He's bewildered, doesn't understand what happened,."
5385,87-1,"and probably starts to chase after her,."
5386,87-1,and she gets back in the carriage.
5387,87-1,"and Go off and the thing, the carriage."
5388,87-1,and the horses are starting to change back.
5389,87-1,"She gets back home, uh, gets undressed back in her chores and stuff."
5390,87-1,and doing her chores.
5391,87-1,The sisters come back and the aunt.
5392,87-1,and they're just Gloating with joy of all the good time.
5393,87-1,"that they had and the prince, I'm sure they were saying to Cinderella, oh, you should have been there, you would have loved it."
5394,87-1,He was handsome.
5395,87-1,"So, They're excited."
5396,87-1,They're hoping.
5397,87-1,"that they might get picked, while Cinderella's all upset."
5398,87-1,And the little mice.
5399,87-1,By the key.
5400,87-1,And they Let her out.
5401,87-1,"Um, because at."
5402,87-1,"that time, the prince is searching for his Princess who lost her slipper."
5403,87-1,And he's going around.
5404,87-1,"and looking for that person, but this time he's at their house."
5405,87-1,"And he is getting ready to,."
5406,87-1,"and maybe has put the slipper on their feet,."
5407,87-1,and it didn't fit.
5408,87-1,Tried both of them.
5409,87-1,"and it didn't fit, so he's disappointed."
5410,87-1,But the mice have helped Cinderella get out that room.
5411,87-1,And she comes down.
5412,87-1,"and he decides he's gonna try to slipper on her, even."
5413,87-1,"though the sisters are thinking, well,."
5414,87-1,that 's not gonna be possible.
5415,87-1,She never went to the ball.
5416,87-1,So he puts the Slipper on her foot.
5417,87-1,"It fits, they are in shock, can't believe it."
5418,87-1,"And um, Then they get married, uh, she becomes a princess,."
5419,87-1,and they live happily ever.
5420,42-1,Once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella.
5421,42-1,"And she was motherless,."
5422,42-1,but she did have a father.
5423,42-1,And the father remarries.
5424,42-1,and brings a stepmother.
5425,42-1,And two of her daughters to the household.
5426,42-1,And this step family is not kind to Cinderella.
5427,42-1,And they make her into a servant.
5428,42-1,"And Cinderella is amazingly tolerant,."
5429,42-1,and then there is a ball.
5430,42-1,"And the stepsisters want to go to the ball,."
5431,42-1,"and Cinderella thinks she's going to go too,."
5432,42-1,"as it turns out, that's not the way that the stepmother thought it would go."
5433,42-1,"So , Um, the Cinderella goes out to the garden."
5434,42-1,and has a fairy godmother.
5435,42-1,"and gets a fancy dress,."
5436,42-1,so she can go to the ball.
5437,42-1,"And the grandmother, the godmother is very, very helpful."
5438,42-1,and makes a um Carriage out of pumpkins.
5439,42-1,and mice turn into coaching and the Cinderella.
5440,42-1,"and the stepsisters do not, they go to the ball, not together, of course,."
5441,42-1,and then there's a beautiful um prince.
5442,42-1,And he Happens to notice Cinderella.
5443,42-1,"and they dance together,."
5444,42-1,"and then at the stroke of midnight, Cinderella has to abide by her contract that she would be back home by then,."
5445,42-1,so she hears the stroke of midnight.
5446,42-1,and runs out to get in the carriage.
5447,42-1,Dropping her glass slipper along the way.
5448,42-1,"And then everything turns back out into reality again, and she's a servant and the cooch is a pumpkin."
5449,42-1,"And then the prince says, I have got to find this woman who had the glass slipper."
5450,42-1,"so he looks at all the girls in the kingdom, and lo."
5451,42-1,"and behold, the glass slipper fits only Cinderella, who by the skin of her teeth gets to try on the slipper too,."
5452,42-1,and then they get married.
5453,42-1,and live happily ever after.
5454,60-1,"This is the story of Cinderella, which she became known as to her stepfamily."
5455,60-1,Cinderella's father married.
5456,60-1,"A woman who ended up being Cinderella's stepmother, I assume."
5457,60-1,that um her real mother had passed away.
5458,60-1,"Um, along with."
5459,60-1,that came two stepsisters.
5460,60-1,"Um, Kind of hideous looking."
5461,60-1,"and acting, and Cinderella was of course a very quiet and nice and sweet young girl."
5462,60-1,"After her father passed away, the what we're going to call evil stepmother, um, just treated Cinderella like she was the help, and , um, not even nicely, not even the nice help."
5463,60-1,"She made her scrub the floors, do all the washing, cooking, uh, and just be at the beck and call of uh her stepmother and two stepsisters."
5464,60-1,"And she kind of took it in stride,."
5465,60-1,"and she became friendly with the birds,."
5466,60-1,"and she loved the animals,."
5467,60-1,and she would converse with them regularly.
5468,60-1,"and found whatever joy she had in her life from those relationships, we'll call it."
5469,60-1,"that Um, there, she even looks out her window uh at the uh magic kingdom, we'll call it,."
5470,60-1,"and um, Just ponders about what it must be like out there cause she's always in the house working and scrubbing."
5471,60-1,And there comes a notice that um the king.
5472,60-1,"Um, we'll have his, uh, prince, his son, I assume, um, going around."
5473,60-1,"and trying to find all the young single women in the kingdom and um Oh,."
5474,60-1,"that comes later, never mind."
5475,60-1,"Um, so he, the, the, they're looking for a bride for the prince."
5476,60-1,"So the prince, um, is going to be the headliner at a a beautiful party and a ball."
5477,60-1,and so all the single women in the The Kingdom are invited to attend.
5478,60-1,So everybody's super excited.
5479,60-1,"The um the, the two evil stepsisters are getting beautiful dresses to wear."
5480,60-1,"and um uh having their hair probably fixed and they're all excited,."
5481,60-1,"but um Cinderella knows now about what's going to happen at the ball,."
5482,60-1,but she is not included.
5483,60-1,"Uh, her stepmother has informed her."
5484,60-1,She needs to stay back.
5485,60-1,and do some work.
5486,60-1,She's not going to be coming.
5487,60-1,"So she's so, so disappointed."
5488,60-1,"And , um, she's sitting down and , and , and , and really sad."
5489,60-1,and all her little animal friends are trying to console her.
5490,60-1,And uh next thing.
5491,60-1,that happens is a fairy godmother appears to her.
5492,60-1,"and says, you, you can go to the ball,."
5493,60-1,and so I have nothing to wear.
5494,60-1,"So she's, you know, looking through the chest."
5495,60-1,that she got when um When she was taken in by the the evil.
5496,60-1,"Stepmother,."
5497,60-1,and it looks.
5498,60-1,like she's found a book.
5499,60-1,I'm not sure what it is.
5500,60-1,"Maybe it's, it's just a book of um."
5501,60-1,Telling you how to do certain things or fables or whatever it is.
5502,60-1,"And so anyway, the fairy godmother is, is, has appeared to her."
5503,60-1,"and says, I can make this happen for you, um."
5504,60-1,And it's bippity boppity boo.
5505,60-1,"In other words, she uses her magic wand."
5506,60-1,and um a beautiful dress appears.
5507,60-1,and the birds are helping to put the little ribbons on it and so forth.
5508,60-1,"And next thing you know, another bippity bobbity bill,."
5509,60-1,and there is a pumpkin.
5510,60-1,"that 's turned into a carriage with two horses to pull it, and she's ready to go to the ball."
5511,60-1,So she's all fixed up beautifully and her outfit is beautiful.
5512,60-1,and she looks wonderful.
5513,60-1,and she comes into the ball.
5514,60-1,and everybody notices her because she's so beautiful.
5515,60-1,and the prince asks her to dance.
5516,60-1,"So they're dancing, but um."
5517,60-1,"as she was told by the Um, Hm."
5518,60-1,"Well, anyway,."
5519,60-1,"as she was told, uh, she could only be out until midnight, at which time she'll turn back and into her grubby clothes and , and um what she normally looks."
5520,60-1,"like So, When she's dancing with the prince, the clock strikes 12,."
5521,60-1,and she has to run off.
5522,60-1,"She doesn't want him to see, um, what she really looks."
5523,60-1,"like So, in the process, one of her slippers comes off."
5524,60-1,"It happens to be a glass slipper,."
5525,60-1,and she's running up the steps.
5526,60-1,"He, he's calling for her, she doesn't respond."
5527,60-1,But all he has left is the one slipper.
5528,60-1,"And he just is so in love with her, he has to find her."
5529,60-1,So when edict goes out.
5530,60-1,"And it says, you know, all the young women."
5531,60-1,"that attended the ball, please be ready."
5532,60-1,"because the prince is coming around door to door,."
5533,60-1,and he's gonna see who fits into this little glass slipper.
5534,60-1,"So this starts to happen and um The prince, it's the next thing, the prince is at the evil stepmother's house,."
5535,60-1,and uh so she can't wait.
5536,60-1,"She just knows her daughter, one of them at least, is going to fit into this slipper."
5537,60-1,"So, uh, the prince's helpers got the slipper on a pillow, uh, and the, the stepdaughters are one by one going to try on the shoes."
5538,60-1,"Well, of course, they have big clunky feet."
5539,60-1,"And uh they can't fit into the slipper,."
5540,60-1,"and they're trying so hard,."
5541,60-1,but they just can't fit into the slipper.
5542,60-1,"So the next one tries and same, same thing happens and the uh their mother is beside herself with grief and hysteria."
5543,60-1,"that they're not going to be one of them at least, the bride for the prince."
5544,60-1,um.
5545,60-1,"Next thing is, I think the prince notices Cinderella."
5546,60-1,"and um says is there, is there anyone else in the house that um young young single lady."
5547,60-1,that could try the slipper on.
5548,60-1,and uh Cidrella gets a chance.
5549,60-1,"Um, not, uh, her stepmother's not very happy about it,."
5550,60-1,but she gets a chance to try on the slipper.
5551,60-1,"It, of course, fits perfectly."
5552,60-1,"And , um, so she has chosen to be the prince's bride,."
5553,60-1,and they marry.
5554,60-1,and live happily ever.
5555,24-1,"Uh, Cinderella, um, was the daughter of, um, A king, I guess it was and um."
5556,24-1,Something happened to the first wife.
5557,24-1,"I'm assuming she died maybe in childbirth,."
5558,24-1,and he remarried.
5559,24-1,and um I believe the stepmother.
5560,24-1,"Killed her husband,."
5561,24-1,if I remember right.
5562,24-1,"And um She, uh, she had 2 daughters, or it was, it's 2, right?"
5563,24-1,Or 32 or 3 daughters and um She.
5564,24-1,and the daughters treated Cinderella badly.
5565,24-1,and didn't treat her like the princess she was.
5566,24-1,"They treated her like she was uh their personal slave and uh They were all, all the daughters were gonna go to um A special ball at the palace, um, to meet the prince."
5567,24-1,And um.
5568,24-1,"so the girl, uh, the three stepsisters all got uh dusied up."
5569,24-1,"and uh were preparing to go,."
5570,24-1,"and Cinderella, of course, was not allowed to go."
5571,24-1,She had to stay home.
5572,24-1,and do her work and all.
5573,24-1,"and the Disney version, they had her talking to the animals and all."
5574,24-1,"that , you know."
5575,24-1,"And singing, of course,."
5576,24-1,"and Disney movies, you have to have singing and um."
5577,24-1,"So , uh, The fairy godmother comes along."
5578,24-1,and says she'll help out Cinderella.
5579,24-1,"so she can go to the um ball,."
5580,24-1,so she waves her magic wand.
5581,24-1,"and has a beautiful dress for her,."
5582,24-1,and she uses the animals.
5583,24-1,and she uses her wand.
5584,24-1,"and turns uh some of them into horses and Uh, the carriage is from a pumpkin, I believe,."
5585,24-1,"and , you know, so everything is all glamorous,."
5586,24-1,and she's gonna make a real entrance when she gets there with her horse drawn carriage.
5587,24-1,"And um of course she's a little late for the party, um,."
5588,24-1,"and she made a grand entrance down the staircase and all that ,."
5589,24-1,and she danced with the prince.
5590,24-1,and the prince fell for her.
5591,24-1,"And um,."
5592,24-1,But she had to be home by midnight.
5593,24-1,And uh.
5594,24-1,so she had to rush out suddenly.
5595,24-1,"And she lost her glass slipper, that 's the only trace of her."
5596,24-1,that was left behind.
5597,24-1,"And uh you know, of course she raced home."
5598,24-1,and she changed back after midnight into her usual self.
5599,24-1,"And then the prince searched high and low with the glass slipper trying to uh find Cinderella and of course, you know, it's uh Stereotypical that the beautiful girl is petite."
5600,24-1,"and has very small feet, you know."
5601,24-1,God forbid the prince would want a a woman with a size 13 shoe.
5602,24-1,"But anyway, he goes around."
5603,24-1,"and , you know, of course, the stepsisters, he tries it on them."
5604,24-1,and they're they're trying their best to wedge their foot into the shoe.
5605,24-1,and they can't get it in the shoe and um.
5606,24-1,I forget how.
5607,24-1,"Uh, he got around to Cinderella,."
5608,24-1,but I guess he found out.
5609,24-1,about her being hidden away.
5610,24-1,and uh put the slipper.
5611,24-1,"and all of a sudden magic, you know, it fits."
5612,05-1,"Uh well, she was, uh, I believe."
5613,05-1,"Uh, taken in by a, uh, more wealthy family to do housework."
5614,05-1,And the family's daughters were quite mean to her.
5615,05-1,And disrespectful.
5616,05-1,"And uh, Somehow I don't remember how she got to uh go to the ball."
5617,05-1,And Had glass slippers.
5618,05-1,"And at midnight, she had to leave."
5619,05-1,"because her ride was gonna turn into a pumpkin,."
5620,05-1,and she was going to be returned to her house work dress.
5621,05-1,"I guess she did, I guess she did marry the prince."
5622,wright07a,His father marries the stepmother.
5623,wright07a,"and um he introduces her to her daughters, the stepmother and the two stepsisters, and the cat, and , um,."
5624,wright07a,and the father goes away.
5625,wright07a,and they make Cinderella do all the chores and all the cleaning and all the dirty work and um.
5626,wright07a,"And then, um, The they get an invitation to a ball and um."
5627,wright07a,"Cinderella wants to go, he said, of course you can't go,."
5628,wright07a,"and the sisters get dressed and ,."
5629,wright07a,and Cinderella goes into her mom's old trunk.
5630,wright07a,"and finds, um, an old dress."
5631,wright07a,"and puts that on and some jewelry and the girls,."
5632,wright07a,that the sisters see her.
5633,wright07a,and they take it away.
5634,wright07a,so you can't go.
5635,wright07a,You have to stay here.
5636,wright07a,and do all our dirty work.
5637,wright07a,"so , uh, they go to the ball."
5638,wright07a,and then this fairy guy shows up.
5639,wright07a,and dresses her up.
5640,wright07a,and gets her in the carriage.
5641,wright07a,and says you gotta go by midnight.
5642,wright07a,so she goes to the ball?
5643,wright07a,"and everybody's like, who's?"
5644,wright07a,that Who's that beautiful girl.
5645,wright07a,and she dances with her friends.
5646,wright07a,And they fall badly in love.
5647,wright07a,"and then she realizes it's almost midnight,."
5648,wright07a,so she has to rush home.
5649,wright07a,and she rushes home.
5650,wright07a,and she loses her shoe on the way.
5651,wright07a,"Um,?"
5652,wright07a,"so , a couple of days later they're coming through the village trying to figure out whose shoe it is,?"
5653,wright07a,and of course all the stepsisters try on the shoe?
5654,wright07a,"and it doesn't fit them,?"
5655,wright07a,"and they go, is there anybody else here?"
5656,wright07a,And Cinderella comes from out of the corner.
5657,wright07a,"and they say, yes."
5658,wright07a,It fits perfectly.
5659,wright07a,and then the prince shows up.
5660,wright07a,and they get married happily ever after.
5661,wright07a,"Right,."
5662,wright07a,that is it for today.
5663,wright07a,"That 's kind of strange, huh?"
5664,capilouto03a,And they treated her like dirt.
5665,capilouto03a,They made her do all the work in the house.
5666,capilouto03a,And She was very unhappy.
5667,capilouto03a,"And the, uh, Princes of the area."
5668,capilouto03a,"Had a was planning a ball and everybody, all he was looking for a wife and all of the."
5669,capilouto03a,Young ladies in the area were invited to come to the ball.
5670,capilouto03a,And the wicked stepmother wouldn't let Cinderella go.
5671,capilouto03a,And left her at home to work.
5672,capilouto03a,And All the animals and the birds.
5673,capilouto03a,"and so on, loved Cinderella,."
5674,capilouto03a,and they got together.
5675,capilouto03a,"And tried to make her feel better, made her a pretty dress to wear."
5676,capilouto03a,But she still couldn't go to the ball.
5677,capilouto03a,until her fairy godmother appeared.
5678,capilouto03a,And Waved a wand over her.
5679,capilouto03a,and made her beautiful in a in a gorgeous dress.
5680,capilouto03a,"And glass slippers,."
5681,capilouto03a,and she made her a carriage out of a pumpkin.
5682,capilouto03a,"And Cinderella rode to the ball,."
5683,capilouto03a,but she was told she had to leave at the stroke of midnight.
5684,capilouto03a,So she went to the ball and her.
5685,capilouto03a,Stepmother and her wicked stepsisters were very upset that she was there.
5686,capilouto03a,She was not supposed to be there.
5687,capilouto03a,And she of course was more beautiful than any of them.
5688,capilouto03a,"And she danced with the prince,."
5689,capilouto03a,"and he fell in love with her,."
5690,capilouto03a,"and when the clock struck midnight, she ran down the stairs."
5691,capilouto03a,So.
5692,capilouto03a,that she could get away when she was supposed to.
5693,capilouto03a,"and Left a glass slipper on the stairs,."
5694,capilouto03a,and the prince sent a man from house to house to try the slipper on every girl's foot.
5695,capilouto03a,"And the fairy, the wicked stepmother, when he came to their house, tried to cram her daughter's feet into the glass slipper,."
5696,capilouto03a,and of course they didn't fit.
5697,capilouto03a,Yeah.
5698,capilouto03a,"And she was, she wasn't going to let Cinderella try the slipper,."
5699,capilouto03a,but the man insisted.
5700,capilouto03a,"So Cinderella tried the slipper,."
5701,capilouto03a,and of course it fit.
5702,capilouto03a,And the prince came.
5703,capilouto03a,"and claimed her, and they were happy ever after."
5704,capilouto03a,"Yeah, OK."
5705,204-1,OK.
5706,204-1,Cinderella's mother has passed away.
5707,204-1,and she's going through her mother's trunk.
5708,204-1,"And in the meantime, her father has remarried."
5709,204-1,"So she has a stepmother now and two stepsisters,."
5710,204-1,"and they treat uh Cinderella like a maid, and in fact, that 's not a real name."
5711,204-1,They called her Cinderella.
5712,204-1,because she had to work at the hearth.
5713,204-1,and became covered with the cinders from the heart.
5714,204-1,"She had to do the work nobody else wanted to do, and they were very mean to her."
5715,204-1,and laughed at her all the time.
5716,204-1,"And uh 1 night there was a ball,."
5717,204-1,"and the two stepsisters got ready and they were very vain,."
5718,204-1,and they thought.
5719,204-1,"that they would capture the heart of the prince, one of them would,."
5720,204-1,"and the mother, certainly stepmother to Cinderella certainly hopes so."
5721,204-1,"And so they went off to the ball,."
5722,204-1,and Cinderella was left behind.
5723,204-1,"and she felt very bad,."
5724,204-1,and she had asked.
5725,204-1,"if she could go to the ball,."
5726,204-1,"and they just laughed at her,."
5727,204-1,and wouldn't let her go.
5728,204-1,And so um her fairy godmother came along.
5729,204-1,And her fairy godmother.
5730,204-1,"Uh, talked to Cinderella."
5731,204-1,"Cinderella said she wanted to go to the ball,."
5732,204-1,"but she didn't have any proper clothes, and so the fairy godmother."
5733,204-1,"Changed her clothes into a beautiful white ball gown,."
5734,204-1,and she changed the carriage or a pumpkin outside the residence.
5735,204-1,"Into a beautiful carriage,."
5736,204-1,"and she gave Cinderella a beautiful glass slippers to wear on her feet,."
5737,204-1,"and she said, but you must be back by midnight."
5738,204-1,And the mice.
5739,204-1,that were running around the hearts in the house were changed to horses to take Cinderella in the carriage to the ball.
5740,204-1,So Cinderella arrived at the ball.
5741,204-1,And everybody turned around?
5742,204-1,and looked when she entered?
5743,204-1,"and said, Who is this?"
5744,204-1,Who is this beautiful woman?
5745,204-1,And the prince said I must meet her.
5746,204-1,And so he went.
5747,204-1,"and introduced himself to Cinderella,."
5748,204-1,and she gave him her hand.
5749,204-1,"and he asked her to dance,."
5750,204-1,and they danced all night long.
5751,204-1,To the consternation of the two sisters and the stepmother.
5752,204-1,Who didn't realize that this was Cinderella.
5753,204-1,"And then all of a sudden Cinderella said, oh, it's almost midnight."
5754,204-1,I must go.
5755,204-1,I must be back by midnight.
5756,204-1,"And so she ran out of the palace, down the steps."
5757,204-1,She ran so fast.
5758,204-1,"that one of her slippers fell off,."
5759,204-1,"and it was left on the step,."
5760,204-1,and the prince ran after her.
5761,204-1,but couldn't catch her.
5762,204-1,He saw the carriage pulling away.
5763,204-1,And so then he said the next day to his footman.
5764,204-1,I must find out who.
5765,204-1,"that beautiful woman was, who I danced with at the ball."
5766,204-1,So I want you to take this slipper.
5767,204-1,And we're going to go to every house.
5768,204-1,until we find the A woman whose foot fits the slipper.
5769,204-1,And so they went to a lot of different houses.
5770,204-1,and the slipper didn't fit.
5771,204-1,"Sometimes it was too big, sometimes too small."
5772,204-1,"They get to the house where Cinderella is living, and the sisters."
5773,204-1,Really want that slipper to fit.
5774,204-1,"And one of them tries to push her foot into it, but her foot is way too big,."
5775,204-1,and she can't get it on.
5776,204-1,"The other one, you try her."
5777,204-1,"and she puts her foot into it, and her foot is too small."
5778,204-1,"And then the prince says, well, there's one more, one more woman here."
5779,204-1,"Let's try this on her foot, and the stepmother."
5780,204-1,and the two daughters just laughed.
5781,204-1,So.
5782,204-1,"that 's Cinderella, you don't want her."
5783,204-1,And so the prince.
5784,204-1,"said, well, we're going to put this slipper on her anyway."
5785,204-1,And so then he put the slipper on her foot.
5786,204-1,"and it fit perfectly,."
5787,204-1,"and he realized that even in her clothing and covered with cinders soot from the cinders, it was the person, the woman he fell in love with at the ball,."
5788,204-1,and so they became betrothed.
5789,204-1,and got married.
5790,204-1,And lived happily ever after.
5791,12-1,"el la lived with her father, her stepmother, and her two stepsisters who were not very nice to her."
5792,12-1,"And , um, there was going to be a ball at the Prince's the king's palace,."
5793,12-1,and they all wanted to go.
5794,12-1,"The girls were all excited and happy,."
5795,12-1,"but , um, Cinderella's stepmother did not want her to go."
5796,12-1,She got beautiful gowns for her two daughters.
5797,12-1,And she gave Cinderella a whole bunch of chores to complete.
5798,12-1,"before she could go, which was almost impossible to do."
5799,12-1,"Um, but she was able to, I think she sewed her own dress, but then the, the sisters were upset with her."
5800,12-1,and they tore it apart.
5801,12-1,"And they left for the ball,."
5802,12-1,"and Cinderella had the help of all the little critters, the mice, and everything in the household, um, to help her."
5803,12-1,"I don't remember what they helped her do though, but , um, then she was out in the garden crying."
5804,12-1,and her fairy godmother came down.
5805,12-1,and waved her magic wand.
5806,12-1,"And gave her a beautiful ball gown,."
5807,12-1,but she told her she had to be home by the.
5808,12-1,or she had to leave and be home by the uh midnight.
5809,12-1,So she went to the Fall.
5810,12-1,and was dancing with the prince.
5811,12-1,"and having a wonderful time,."
5812,12-1,"and when she heard the clock start to strike 12,."
5813,12-1,and she ran out of the out of the ball.
5814,12-1,and running down the steps she lost her one of her glass slippers.
5815,12-1,And uh she got him.
5816,12-1,"And the next day, the prince was so enamored with her."
5817,12-1,"He wanted to find her, so they went all through the kingdom to try to find who the glass slipper fit."
5818,12-1,"And her stepsisters tried their best to make it fit on their feet,."
5819,12-1,"but they, they couldn't do it."
5820,12-1,And then the gap got to Cinderella.
5821,12-1,and it hit her foot.
5822,12-1,and Then she went off with the prince.
5823,12-1,and lived happily ever after.
5824,neural18-1,"So, I guess it, it was a long time ago."
5825,neural18-1,that there was a woman.
5826,neural18-1,"and she had 2 daughters and a man who had a daughter,."
5827,neural18-1,and Cinderella ended up in this home with two stepsisters.
5828,neural18-1,And they were unpleasant to her.
5829,neural18-1,because she Always seemed to make everything look happy.
5830,neural18-1,"and bright, even animals cheered up when they were around her,."
5831,neural18-1,"because she just let off this gift of light and love, and , and the sisters were very jealous, and the stepmother was very jealous also."
5832,neural18-1,So they mistreated Cinderella.
5833,neural18-1,and had her do terrible things uh.
5834,neural18-1,that none of them wanted to do.
5835,neural18-1,"So, Cinderella would gaze outside."
5836,neural18-1,"and look at the castle,."
5837,neural18-1,and wonder about what life was like outside of the walls she lived in.
5838,neural18-1,"And The castle, there was a, a family, obviously who lived there,."
5839,neural18-1,"and the prince um was looking to find love and get married,."
5840,neural18-1,and decided to have a big ball.
5841,neural18-1,and have all everyone in the entire village come to this ball.
5842,neural18-1,"So, Cinderella's stepsisters, um, Got all of their, you know, their lovely items together, and their dresses and their hair, and all of these things,."
5843,neural18-1,"and Cinderella also wanted to go to the ball, Since her stepmother."
5844,neural18-1,"and her stepsisters didn't help her, all of the animals did."
5845,neural18-1,"So the, the animals who loved Cinderella because she was so good, put together a beautiful gown for her."
5846,neural18-1,And just.
5847,neural18-1,"as Cinderella thought she was gonna get out of the house, um, her stepsisters."
5848,neural18-1,"and her stepmother ruined her gown, and she was very, very sad,."
5849,neural18-1,and the stepsisters went off to the ball.
5850,neural18-1,"and Cinderella was left with, you know, ripped up dress and , and nothing to do."
5851,neural18-1,"So, this fairy godmother showed up."
5852,neural18-1,"and said, Cinderella, you are such a nice person, you're such a good person,."
5853,neural18-1,"and you have so much love to give, and you're so much light."
5854,neural18-1,I really want you to go to the ball.

5856,neural18-1,"and it's gonna be so lovely,."
5857,neural18-1,"but it ends at midnight, so you have to make sure you come home before then."
5858,neural18-1,"So, Cinderella goes to the ball and her stepsisters were not pleased."
5859,neural18-1,because everyone stared at Cinderella when she came in because she was just so beautiful.
5860,neural18-1,"And the prince, of course, noticed her beauty and grace, and Again, this kind of calm, light."
5861,neural18-1,Soothing to people.
5862,neural18-1,"that she let off,."

5869,neural18-1,"that was found at the ball,."
5870,neural18-1,"and tried it on every woman in town,."
5871,neural18-1,and it fits Cinderella.

5982,neural26-1,"She had to do chores,."
5983,neural26-1,but her daughters could go.
5984,neural26-1,"And they had beautiful dresses,."
5985,neural26-1,but she banished Cinderella.
5986,neural26-1,into doing chores.
5987,neural26-1,And Cinderella was dreaming.
5988,neural26-1,that she could go to the ball.
5989,neural26-1,and she had a fairy godmother appear.
5990,neural26-1,"and um She turned her Garb into a nice ball gown and the horse into um uh A pumpkin into a chariot and a horse into a um steed,."
5991,neural26-1,and she got to go to the ball.
5992,neural26-1,"And at the ball, the prince noticed her right away."
5993,neural26-1,and they danced the night away.
5994,neural26-1,"And um when the clock struck 12, she was supposed to be home."
5995,neural26-1,"And um she heard the bells ringing,."
5996,neural26-1,and she ran off from the prince.
5997,neural26-1,before he ever got her name.
5998,neural26-1,So she made it home and her stepmother.
5999,neural26-1,and stepsisters did not even know she had gone to the ball.
6000,neural26-1,"And , um, but the prince was determined to find out who he was dancing with all night long, so In her haste."
6001,neural26-1,"of leaving the ball, she dropped one."
6002,neural26-1,"of her slippers, so the prince Um, sent around the slipper throughout the town."
6003,neural26-1,and um wanted to find out the foot.
6004,neural26-1,that would fit the glass slipper.
6005,neural26-1,"And um when they came to their house, both stepsisters tried it on."
6006,neural26-1,and it would not fit.
6007,neural26-1,"And Cinderella said, I would like to try it on."
6008,neural26-1,"So regrettingly, they let Cinderella try on the slipper."
6009,neural26-1,"and it fit, and her."
6010,neural26-1,and her prince lived happily ever after.
6011,48-1,"Once upon a time, there was a man who lost his wife."
6012,48-1,and had decided to bring in a new wife who happened to have two children of her own.
6013,48-1,"When they were still small, he introduced his daughter to his new wife, who would then be her stepmother and her two new stepsisters."
6014,48-1,As they aged.
6015,48-1,"and grew up, Cinderella became less of a daughter and more of just a maid working."
6016,48-1,for The stepmother and the stepdaughters.
6017,48-1,Apparently papa had died.
6018,48-1,and could no longer See to the welfare of his own child.
6019,48-1,As they continued to Move on in life The stepmother.
6020,48-1,Kept Cinderella.
6021,48-1,"In the dark, in the basement, or at least not."
6022,48-1,in keeping with the rest of the household.
6023,48-1,Cinderella made friends with the mice and the dogs and the horses that were part of her milieu.
6024,48-1,And had become her real family.
6025,48-1,Even the birds.
6026,48-1,that sang to her would come.
6027,48-1,and keep her company.

6035,48-1,But Cinderella's stepmother.
6036,48-1,was not going to allow Cinderella even a dress.
6037,48-1,in which to accompany the rest of the family.
6038,48-1,"Cinderella found a book in a chest apparently left by her parents, and was able to make a dress with the help of her animal friends."
6039,48-1,"And put together a lovely gown, and when it was time to leave for the ball, her stepsisters and stepmother."
6040,48-1,tore the dress apart.
6041,48-1,and refused to allow Cinderella to accompany them.

6049,48-1,that she could.
6050,48-1,Arrive at the ball in true style.
6051,48-1,Once at the bally.
6052,48-1,was the prince's only Attraction.
6053,48-1,"He paid no attention to anyone but Cinderella, but at the stroke of midnight,."
6054,48-1,"as her Godmother had said, She had to leave the ball."
6055,48-1,as not to Disturbed the enchantment under the eyes of any onlookers.
6056,48-1,"She arrived back home just in time,."
6057,48-1,but she had lost her glass slipper on the steps of the palace.
6058,48-1,In the next days.
6059,48-1,"The prince, having found the shoe."
6060,48-1,"Went looking for the person whose foot would fit that shoe,."
6061,48-1,after having traversed the entire kingdom looking for the one woman whose foot would fit.
6062,48-1,"that shoe, he comes across the stepsisters and stepmother."
6063,48-1,"And at last, Cinderella is allowed to try on the shoe, which fits perfectly."
6064,48-1,And leads to happily ever.
6065,neural40-1,"Oh my goodness, OK."
6066,neural40-1,"Uh, Becca would be really good at this."
6067,neural40-1,"Um, as ,."
6068,neural40-1,"as Cinderella was adopted by her stepmom and her stepsisters, who were very spoiled brats, and the stepmom was an evil woman."
6069,neural40-1,"She made Cinderella do all kinds of chores, um,."
6070,neural40-1,"but Cinderella also fell in love with the, the animals that were there at the house,."
6071,neural40-1,and they befriended her.
6072,neural40-1,"Um, she looked longingly out of a window to the castle."
6073,neural40-1,"and thought how cool it would be to one day go there, which those sisters thought were absolutely absurd."
6074,neural40-1,that she would ever go to the castle.
6075,neural40-1,And one day they found out.
6076,neural40-1,"that there was going to be a ball at the castle,."
6077,neural40-1,"and so the stepsisters had their dresses made, uh,."
6078,neural40-1,"but Cinderella couldn't go cause she, she was a maid, she didn't have a dress."
6079,neural40-1,So her fairy godmother decided.
6080,neural40-1,"that Cinderella needed to go to the castle and be happy, so she waved her wand, made her a dress."
6081,neural40-1,"Oh my goodness, it was beautiful, uh, did her wand."
6082,neural40-1,"and made the pumpkin into a beautiful coach,."
6083,neural40-1,"and she rode into the castle with a beautiful dress and glass slippers,."
6084,neural40-1,"and saw the prince,."
6085,neural40-1,and they fell in love almost immediately.
6086,neural40-1,after they were dancing.
6087,neural40-1,"But then the clock struck midnight,."
6088,neural40-1,and she had to go because she was about to be changed back into a maid.
6089,neural40-1,So.
6090,neural40-1,"as she was running, she lost her slipper, which the prince actually found,."
6091,neural40-1,"and he wanted to find out who this belonged to,."
6092,neural40-1,that was going to be his wife.
6093,neural40-1,"So he actually, uh, actually his servant came out."
6094,neural40-1,"and tried all the shoes, uh, first of all, on the sisters,."
6095,neural40-1,and of course it didn't fit.
6096,neural40-1,cause they had big fat fucking feet.
6097,neural40-1,"Sorry, sorry."
6098,neural40-1,"Um, so then they tried on Cinderella."
6099,neural40-1,and of course it fit perfectly.
6100,neural40-1,And so they were reunite reunited with each other.
6101,neural40-1,and they lived happily ever.
6102,wright04a,Once a pound.

6193,wright04a,Slipper.
6194,wright04a,Like Super.

6196,wright04a,And you can see Shows the.
6197,wright04a,OK.
6198,wright04a,Carriages.
6199,wright04a,"as they say, You didn't go to school?"
6200,wright04a,No.
6201,neural6-1,OK.
6202,neural6-1,Once there was a gentleman.
6203,neural6-1,"And he lived with his wife,."
6204,neural6-1,and they had a lovely little girl.
6205,neural6-1,"But unfortunately, the wife died."
6206,neural6-1,"And over the course of time, the man was lonely,."
6207,neural6-1,so he met another woman.
6208,neural6-1,"that he wanted to marry,."
6209,neural6-1,and this woman had 3 daughters.
6210,neural6-1,"He brought her to his home,."
6211,neural6-1,and he introduced her to his daughter.
6212,neural6-1,And the 3 daughters and the.
6213,neural6-1,"and the mother were very, very richly dressed, and really at that time, so was his daughter."
6214,neural6-1,"Uh,."
6215,neural6-1,"as time went on,."
6216,neural6-1,"and he married, he married this woman,."
6217,neural6-1,"and they were all living together, um, It became apparent that the mother, who of course was the stepmother."
6218,neural6-1,"of Cinderella, was favoring her daughters quite a bit more than uh."
6219,neural6-1,than she was.
6220,neural6-1,The man's daughter.
6221,neural6-1,"In fact, the daughter had the, the man's daughter had to do so much work."
6222,neural6-1,And had.
6223,neural6-1,"and ended up spending her nights by the fireplace instead in bed,."
6224,neural6-1,"so she was covered with ashes from the fireplace,."
6225,neural6-1,so they started to mock her.
6226,neural6-1,and calling her Cinderella.
6227,neural6-1,"The stepsisters were unkind, mean, nasty,."
6228,neural6-1,and basically made Cinderella's life very unpleasant.
6229,neural6-1,In the kingdom where this family lived was a king.
6230,neural6-1,"who had a son, who was a very handsome prince."
6231,neural6-1,The son was not yet married.
6232,neural6-1,and didn't haven't really found anybody that he was interested.
6233,neural6-1,"in marrying,."
6234,neural6-1,"so the king decided to have a ball to introduce his son to all the ladies in the land,."
6235,neural6-1,"that he could find someone to marry, cause the king was very anxious for his son to be married."
6236,neural6-1,So they send out invitations to everyone in the whole kingdom.
6237,neural6-1,"The invitation came to the house of our, of our hero family,."
6238,neural6-1,"and they, um They received the invitation, and everybody is ecstatic,."
6239,neural6-1,"and the daughters, the stepdaughters go around, uh, no, sorry, the stepsisters go around."
6240,neural6-1,"and try to find all the most beautiful things to wear, and Cinderella,."
6241,neural6-1,"of course, is really wanting to go to the ball too, and ,."
6242,neural6-1,but the stepsisters mock her.
6243,neural6-1,and tell her.
6244,neural6-1,that there's no place.
6245,neural6-1,"for someone like her at the ball, she will have to stay home,."
6246,neural6-1,while they wear all their beautiful clothes.
6247,neural6-1,and go out to the ball.
6248,neural6-1,She's not happy about this.
6249,neural6-1,And she uh spends some time talking to her animal friends about how sad she is.
6250,neural6-1,and how much she wishes she could go to the ball.
6251,neural6-1,So the evening.
6252,neural6-1,"of the ball comes, and the stepmother."
6253,neural6-1,"and the stepsisters, I honestly don't know."
6254,neural6-1,if the father went to the ball or not.
6255,neural6-1,"He may have, but he, but anyway, probably did."
6256,neural6-1,"So they all left to go to the ball,."
6257,neural6-1,"and Cinderella is just feeling desperately sad, and , and , so ,."
6258,neural6-1,so feeling so bad about not being able to go.
6259,neural6-1,And all.
6260,neural6-1,"of a sudden, She realizes there's somebody in the room with her there."
6261,neural6-1,"And she's, who is this person?"
6262,neural6-1,Who are you?
6263,neural6-1,"And the woman says, I am your fairy godmother."
6264,neural6-1,And I'm going to help you go to the ball.
6265,neural6-1,"Well,."
6266,neural6-1,"of course, Cinderel's thrilled."
6267,neural6-1,"so the fairy godmother finds a pumpkin,."
6268,neural6-1,"and changes the pumpkin into a coach, finds rats,."
6269,neural6-1,"and changes the rats into the horses, finds some mice,."
6270,neural6-1,"and makes the mice into the coachman and the footman,."
6271,neural6-1,"and they're all elegantly dressed, it's all beautiful,."
6272,neural6-1,and then Cinderella stands there.
6273,neural6-1,"in her rag saying, I can't go to the ball, I can't go living like this, and the fairy godmother."
6274,neural6-1,"Does her magic, Cinderella spins around,."
6275,neural6-1,"and when she comes back, she is all beautifully dressed in this beautiful, gorgeous ball gown, and has on the most amazing slippers, which In ancient French, were the same which were fur, which is the same homophone word as glass,."
6276,neural6-1,"so it was, it became an English glass, so these were glass slippers."
6277,neural6-1,"that she wore,."
6278,neural6-1,and which sounds really uncomfortable.
6279,neural6-1,"Anyway, she went to the ball in her beautiful coach."
6280,neural6-1,The minute she walked?
6281,neural6-1,"in , everybody is whispering?"
6282,neural6-1,and wondering who in the heck is this?
6283,neural6-1,They've never seen her.
6284,neural6-1,"before , they have no idea who she is."
6285,neural6-1,"The, the her stepmother."
6286,neural6-1,"and her stepsisters are stunned by the beauty of this young woman, and , and ,."
6287,neural6-1,"and think they probably need to go make friends with her and ,."
6288,neural6-1,"and see what's going on, but The prince,."
6289,neural6-1,"of course, has his head completely turned."
6290,neural6-1,And he practically falls.
6291,neural6-1,in love at first sight.
6292,neural6-1,"He asks her to dance, they dance together."
6293,neural6-1,"He doesn't dance with anybody else the rest of the ball, which makes people very, very green with envy."
6294,neural6-1,"And he, uh, 00, I need to go back to the fairy godmother."
6295,neural6-1,"because she said, Something very important to Cinderella."
6296,neural6-1,"before she left, she said, you must return home, must leave the ball."
6297,neural6-1,"before the clocks finished striking 12,."
6298,neural6-1,because then everything will go back to the way it was.
6299,neural6-1,So Cinderella was always kind of conscious.
6300,neural6-1,"of this, thought."
6301,neural6-1,that she was dancing.
6302,neural6-1,"and having a wonderful time,."
6303,neural6-1,but she always wanted to pay attention to what time it was.
6304,neural6-1,"Well, they had this one wonderful waltz,."
6305,neural6-1,"and they were waltzing around the room together, and , and it was just absolutely beautiful when she heard the clock strike."
6306,neural6-1,"Oh, she knew she had to get out of there right away,."
6307,neural6-1,so she ran.
6308,neural6-1,Away.
6309,neural6-1,without trying to say anything to the prince.
6310,neural6-1,"The prince is shocked, he doesn't know what's going on, he follows her,."
6311,neural6-1,"and she runs down the stairs, and ,."
6312,neural6-1,"and he's trying to, to catch her,."
6313,neural6-1,but he knows she has to get away.
6314,neural6-1,before everything changes back to the way it was.
6315,neural6-1,"And she,."
6316,neural6-1,"as she runs down the stairs, she leaves one of her glass slippers behind."
6317,neural6-1,"She runs out into the street,."
6318,neural6-1,"and whew, the clock finishes striking 12, and everything's back."
6319,neural6-1,"She's back to pumpkin and rats and mice, and she's back to her rags,."
6320,neural6-1,so she goes home.
6321,neural6-1,"The next day, the stepsisters."
6322,neural6-1,"and the stepmother were raving about the ball,."
6323,neural6-1,"and telling all kinds of stories about how wonderful the stepsisters were,."
6324,neural6-1,"and how many men were following them around, including the prince, except then they started kind."
6325,neural6-1,of talking about this young woman who was dancing with the prince and kind.
6326,neural6-1,"of monopolizing his time, and they were really annoyed."

6337,neural6-1,"of course, put their feet into the slippers,."
6338,neural6-1,"so they cut off their toes,."
6339,neural6-1,"and they cut off their heels,."

6352,neural6-1,"and they get married and with all kinds of fanfare,."
6353,neural6-1,and they live happily ever after.
6354,neural6-1,The end.
6355,90-1,"OK, so this is the story of Cinderella, who um was an only child."
6356,90-1,"Her father was a widower,."
6357,90-1,"and he met, um, a woman who already had two children."
6358,90-1,"So they got married, um,."
6359,90-1,"and became a family,."
6360,90-1,"but then Cinderella's father died,."
6361,90-1,"and Cinderella was then made to be the, um, She wasn't really a sister in the family or daughter, she was more of a servant to the family, and Cinderella, her only friends were um these animals uh that were."
6362,90-1,"Where they lived at,."
6363,90-1,and one day there was a A ball.
6364,90-1,that was going to happen.
6365,90-1,Uh there was a prince.
6366,90-1,"and his father wanted him to find a bride, so he planned a ball for um his son, the prince,."
6367,90-1,"and then invitations were sent out to, you know, all the eligible girls in the area."
6368,90-1,"And when the invitation came, Cinderella found out."
6369,90-1,that she wasn't going to be invited.
6370,90-1,"Um,."
6371,90-1,"but she put together, actually, I think she put together the dress."
6372,90-1,"and decided she was gonna go to the ball too, so she made her own dress, put it together,."
6373,90-1,"and then when she was ready to go, the stepsisters told her nose."
6374,90-1,"that she couldn't,."
6375,90-1,and they started to rip apart her dress.
6376,90-1,and so it was left in tatters.
6377,90-1,"and they went to the ball without her, um,."
6378,90-1,and she started to cry.
6379,90-1,"and Um, her fairy godmother appeared."
6380,90-1,and told her.
6381,90-1,"that she was gonna go to the ball, so I believe she turned some of the animals and objects that were there in her home into um a pumpkin carriage."
6382,90-1,and told her she could go to the ball.
6383,90-1,She um gave her glass slippers.
6384,90-1,The only problem was is.
6385,90-1,"that at midnight when the clock struck midnight, she was gonna Um, everything was gonna go back to the way it was, so she went ahead."
6386,90-1,"and went to the ball, had a great time."
6387,90-1,"Prince saw her, fell in love with her,."
6388,90-1,"and um, Then all of a sudden the clock struck 12."
6389,90-1,and so she started to to run.
6390,90-1,because she knew what was gonna happen.
6391,90-1,And um.
6392,90-1,"as she was running, one of her slippers fell off."
6393,90-1,"and then Um, The slipper was used to find Cinderella,."
6394,90-1,and so there was somebody from the castle.
6395,90-1,"that was going to all the different homes,."
6396,90-1,"and everybody was, all the girls, all the women were trying on the the slipper,."
6397,90-1,and they went to her home.
6398,90-1,"and she was locked away, um."
6399,90-1,but her little Animal friends slipped her a key and she was able to get out and she was able to put on the slipper.
6400,90-1,"and found out that yes, she was the one."
6401,90-1,"that the um prince had fallen in love to love with,."
6402,90-1,and they lived happily ever after.
6403,capilouto07a,"Once upon a time in a land far away, a man lived with his pretty young daughter."
6404,capilouto07a,His wife had died.
6405,capilouto07a,One day he met a woman.
6406,capilouto07a,and decided.
6407,capilouto07a,that he would marry her.
6408,capilouto07a,"She had two daughters of her own,."
6409,capilouto07a,"and she didn't look like a very pleasant person,."
6410,capilouto07a,"but he was besotted, I guess,."
6411,capilouto07a,and he married her.
6412,capilouto07a,And so they all came to live together.
6413,capilouto07a,"and unfortunately, his daughter, Cinderella was treated rather shabbily by the stepmother and the stepsisters."
6414,capilouto07a,She was made to do all the housework.
6415,capilouto07a,"and she was, she was made to, you know, take care of everything and her only friends were the mice and , um, and ,."
6416,capilouto07a,and so she was living a rather miserable existence.
6417,capilouto07a,"In the meantime, in the castle in the distance lived a king who wanted his son to get married."
6418,capilouto07a,"He said, OK, it's time, you need to find a wife."
6419,capilouto07a,So they decided to have a ball.
6420,capilouto07a,and they sent out invitations all over the land for people to come to the ball.
6421,capilouto07a,"Of course, the stepmother got the invitation."
6422,capilouto07a,and was simply thrilled.
6423,capilouto07a,All the girls were very excited.
6424,capilouto07a,Surely one.
6425,capilouto07a,of them was going to get to marry the prince.
6426,capilouto07a,"and they got all this finery, and the night."
6427,capilouto07a,of the ball came.
6428,capilouto07a,and Cinderella put on a pretty dress.
6429,capilouto07a,that the mice had somehow arranged for her.
6430,capilouto07a,"And , uh, they told her, no, you can't go, you stay home."
6431,capilouto07a,So they went off to the ball.
6432,capilouto07a,Cinderella was rather dejected?
6433,capilouto07a,and she went out in the garden?
6434,capilouto07a,and there was a fairy godmother?
6435,capilouto07a,"and she said, What's the matter, Cinderella?"
6436,capilouto07a,"And Cinderella said, well, I want to go to the ball, I can't go to the ball."
6437,capilouto07a,"The fairy godmother said, I will arrange."
6438,capilouto07a,for you to go to the ball.
6439,capilouto07a,She waved her magic wand.
6440,capilouto07a,and dress turned into a beautiful ball gown.
6441,capilouto07a,She waved it again.
6442,capilouto07a,"The pumpkin turned into a coach,."
6443,capilouto07a,and the mice became the horses to carry her to the ball and possibly a footman.
6444,capilouto07a,So she went to the ball.
6445,capilouto07a,and the prince was smitten with her.
6446,capilouto07a,and danced with her.
6447,capilouto07a,"Oh, the, the fairy godmother had told her she had to be home by midnight."
6448,capilouto07a,So now she's dancing with the prince.
6449,capilouto07a,"and she hears the clock start to strike, so she realizes she has to leave."
6450,capilouto07a,01 of the pieces of finery the fairy godmother provided was a pair of glass slippers.
6451,capilouto07a,"So she runs away from the prince, runs down the steps, in the course."
6452,capilouto07a,"of running down the steps, steps out of one."
6453,capilouto07a,"of her glass slippers, leaves it behind, runs to the coach, and ,."
6454,capilouto07a,and goes home.
6455,capilouto07a,"Now the prince is left with only a glass slipper and a memory of this gorgeous young woman,."
6456,capilouto07a,and he decides to go throughout the land.
6457,capilouto07a,and try to find her.
6458,capilouto07a,Whoever will fit in the slipper will be his bride.
6459,capilouto07a,"So he goes around, he gets to the house where the, where Cinderella lives,."
6460,capilouto07a,"and um, The wicked stepsisters can't fit in the shoe,."
6461,capilouto07a,"although they try,."
6462,capilouto07a,"of course the shoe fits Cinderella,."
6463,capilouto07a,and so he's found his princess.
6464,capilouto07a,and they get married.
6465,capilouto07a,"and live happily ever after,."
6466,capilouto07a,and you know it's a fairy tale.
6467,229-1,"at OK, um, well, Cinderella was, uh, living with, I think there are two mean sisters."
6468,229-1,"and all the sisters are getting ready to go to the ball and no Cinderella, you can't go, you're ugly, you're terrible, um."
6469,229-1,"She Somehow, I don't remember exactly how um came across her very godmother who waved her magic wand."
6470,229-1,and Cinderella suddenly has a beautiful gown on and the carriage to take her to the ball.
6471,229-1,But the caveat is you gotta be home by midnight.
6472,229-1,"So she goes to the ball, has a wonderful time, dances with the handsome prince,."
6473,229-1,and The two sisters are the siblings are looking.
6474,229-1,"on thinking this is terrible, she can't do this."
6475,229-1,"Um Suddenly realizes the time races to get to the carriage to take her back by midnight, loses a slipper along the way,."
6476,229-1,and the prince searches the kingdom for.
6477,229-1,"The person that Fits the slipper, and she eventually,."
6478,229-1,"or he, rather eventually finds Cinderella slipper fits."
6479,229-1,and They both live happily ever after.
6480,227-1,"Cinderella, um, Come to their house."
6481,227-1,Um she is Not treated well.

6505,65-1,"OK, don't remember that many details about Cinderella,."
6506,65-1,that she lived in a house.
6507,65-1,She was sort of a stepdaughter.
6508,65-1,and was always forced to do the housework around the house.
6509,65-1,"and there were some, um, I don't know whether they were stepsisters or whatever."
6510,65-1,that were treated much better.
6511,65-1,than she was.
6512,65-1,"Um, at some point she She gets to go to a ball."
6513,65-1,and meets Prince Charming.
6514,65-1,And there was something about her shoe where.

6516,65-1,Ended up with the prince or something like.

6518,65-1,"and I don't have a whole lot of details there big memory of Cinderella,."
6519,65-1,but I assume she lived happily ever after.
6520,271-1,"Oh, OK."
6521,271-1,OK.
6522,271-1,"The Cinderella, who lives with her stepmom and two stepsisters, um, Cinderella is more or less sort of relegated."
6523,271-1,to doing housework and whatnot.
6524,271-1,She's certainly not treated on equal terms as a two stepsisters.
6525,271-1,Someone comes around.
6526,271-1,"Invite Um,."
6527,271-1,and there's a stepmom of Cinderella's.
6528,271-1,"There's an announcement, a public announcement."
6529,271-1,"that 's made about a grand ball or whatever, and her two sisters are very excited."

6536,271-1,They get dressed.
6537,271-1,to go.
6538,271-1,"to go to the ball, and Cinderella is very sad, crying, um,."
6539,271-1,but then her fairy dog mother shows up.
6540,271-1,"Um,."
6541,271-1,And she tells Cinderella.
6542,271-1,that she can go through the ball.
6543,271-1,that she has to be back by 12 midnight.
6544,271-1,Cinderella space when she doesn't have a gown or whatever transportation very stepgrandmother.
6545,271-1,"So I guess that 's a wand, turns a pumpkin into a carriage, the mice into horsemen."
6546,271-1,"Cinderella has a beautiful gown, goes."
6547,271-1,"to the ball, have a great time."
6548,271-1,No one really knows who she is.
6549,271-1,and she's having such a great time.
6550,271-1,"that she forgets about her, her curfew,."
6551,271-1,if you will.
6552,271-1,"And when the clock strikes 12, she runs."
6553,271-1,"Out of the ballroom, she's had a fantastic time with Charming Prince."
6554,271-1,"um,."
6555,271-1,"but on her way out, she loses a slipper."
6556,271-1,Is.
6557,271-1,"that everything turns back, the horseman turns back into the mice, the pumpkin,."
6558,271-1,and The prince is not trying.
6559,271-1,to find this young lady who he got.
6560,271-1,to meet.
6561,271-1,"No one knows who she is, who he wants."
6562,271-1,"to So he takes the slipper around from house to house, gets to Cinderella's house, and of course her stepsister's high on the slipper,."
6563,271-1,but it doesn't fit.
6564,271-1,They want.
6565,271-1,to know they're not anyone else.
6566,271-1,"There's one, but oh, she wasn't there,."
6567,271-1,but Cinderella comes up.
6568,271-1,Her her foot fits into the slippers.
6569,271-1,And it's.
6570,271-1,like I have a happily ever after.
6571,capilouto09a,"OK, this is the story of Cinderella."
6572,capilouto09a,She finds a magic shoe.
6573,capilouto09a,"But that, She turns back to, uh, Well, she has a deadline."
6574,capilouto09a,"If she doesn't, Get home by a certain time."
6575,capilouto09a,"I'm not familiar with the, that familiar with the Cinderella story."
6576,capilouto09a,But I think she gets back in time.
6577,capilouto09a,And then she marries a prince.
6578,neural17-1,Mm.
6579,neural17-1,"So Um, Well, I know the gist of it, uh, but not every detail."
6580,neural17-1,"So, um, Cinderella had, has two stepsisters, um, and I'm not sure if her father is a prince or a prominent person,."
6581,neural17-1,"but , um, Uh, the stepsisters get favored, um, All the time by the stepmother."
6582,neural17-1,"and Cinderella, in effect, has to serve them, wait."
6583,neural17-1,"on them, clean the house, do all the heavy lifting."
6584,neural17-1,while the two sisters don't have to do anything.
6585,neural17-1,"And then they get invited to a ball, uh, a dancing ball, and , um, they're all excited."
6586,neural17-1,and it looks.
6587,neural17-1,"like Cinderella had a dress to wear, um,."
6588,neural17-1,and was planning.
6589,neural17-1,"on going to the ball,."
6590,neural17-1,but it looks.
6591,neural17-1,like they took the ribbon off of her dress.
6592,neural17-1,Which I don't remember.
6593,neural17-1,"Um, I thought she didn't have anything."
6594,neural17-1,"That she wasn't expected to go,."
6595,neural17-1,"but um from the book, it looked."
6596,neural17-1,"like they, she had found something to wear."
6597,neural17-1,"Uh,."
6598,neural17-1,"but anyway, so the stepsisters went without her thinking Cinderella was not going to go and ,."
6599,neural17-1,and um a fairy godmother came.
6600,neural17-1,and helped Cinderella with a beautiful dress and a fantastic.
6601,neural17-1,carriage.
6602,neural17-1,that she turned into from a pumpkin and mice.
6603,neural17-1,that turned into horses.
6604,neural17-1,"and Um, she goes in this grand style to the ball,."
6605,neural17-1,of course the prince likes her the best and dances with her the most.
6606,neural17-1,"And then she's gotta leave suddenly at noon, at midnight."
6607,neural17-1,"because her fairy godmother said, you can have all this, but it's only good until midnight and then be home by then."
6608,neural17-1,because everything is going to go away.
6609,neural17-1,"The horses turned back into mice, the carriage turns into a pumpkin,."
6610,neural17-1,and you are going to have your regular clothes.
6611,neural17-1,on So she leaves at midnight and the prince is heartbroken.
6612,neural17-1,And in the course.
6613,neural17-1,"of her running away to make it by midnight, she drops one of her glass slippers."
6614,neural17-1,and uh the prince gets it.
6615,neural17-1,And um So then the prince has his men search high and low for every woman.
6616,neural17-1,that Who can try this glass slipper and uh that 's how he finds her.
6617,neural17-1,So it only fits her foot.
6618,neural17-1,So she tries it.
6619,neural17-1,and then the princes identified her.
6620,neural17-1,and they get married.
6621,neural17-1,and they live happily ever after.
6622,capilouto11a,"OK, in this,."
6623,capilouto11a,"in this story, uh, Cinderella, uh, it begins with Cinderella as a little girl."
6624,capilouto11a,She's in the home.
6625,capilouto11a,"of her father, um, she has a, a, uh, little puppy dog who's her friend."
6626,capilouto11a,"Uh, her father is, uh, remarries to, um, uh, to a woman who has two young girls of her own."
6627,capilouto11a,"Um, the, uh,."
6628,capilouto11a,"and the story starts with , with the, that new family coming together."
6629,capilouto11a,"Um, the stepmother, uh, turns out to be a rather, uh, unlikable character here."
6630,capilouto11a,"She doesn't really care for her new stepdaughter, um, that 's actually the last time we see the father."
6631,capilouto11a,"So presumably the father disappears somehow, he dies or ,."
6632,capilouto11a,"or something happens, so he's removed from the, the family."
6633,capilouto11a,"Um, the rest of the, the rest of the discussion kind."
6634,capilouto11a,"of focuses on, her story focuses on the interactions."

6638,capilouto11a,"and the, uh, stepsisters, uh, abuse her and ,."
6639,capilouto11a,"and really use her as a, as a servant for the family."
6640,capilouto11a,"Um, Cinderella is, uh, is, is a very, is a good hearted, good natured, uh, young woman."
6641,capilouto11a,"She, she takes it all."
6642,capilouto11a,"in stride, tries to do her best in , in , uh, her new place within this family."
6643,capilouto11a,"Um, the stepmother."
6644,capilouto11a,"and stepsisters really never, never develop any affinity for her,."
6645,capilouto11a,"but Cinderella, uh, develops a fondness for many animals, including her dog, but then also mice and , uh, uh, other animals in the, uh, in the environment of her, of her home."
6646,capilouto11a,She happens to live very close by to the castle.
6647,capilouto11a,and sees the castle every day looking out the window and dreams of all the wonderful things.
6648,capilouto11a,that happened.
6649,capilouto11a,"that place, uh, but it's, uh, clearly outside of her reach."
6650,capilouto11a,"Uh, one day the chancellor and other staff within the castle, um, Decide."
6651,capilouto11a,"that they have to have a ball because the young prince is at a point where he needs to select a bride to, to get married to carry on the, the, uh, the lineage of the royal family."
6652,capilouto11a,"And so they send out a notice to all of the families in town, uh, inviting, uh, uh, particularly inviting all of the young women who are of marriageable age to, uh, to come to this ball and ,."
6653,capilouto11a,"and to dance with the prince and , and ,."
6654,capilouto11a,"and possibly be, be, uh, Ask for their, their hand in marriage."
6655,capilouto11a,And so the stepmother is very excited.
6656,capilouto11a,"and wants to, 11 of her, of her two biological daughters to, to be the, to, to be the one selected."
6657,capilouto11a,and so goes on.
6658,capilouto11a,"and begins with preparations to, to, uh, Uh,."
6659,capilouto11a,for them to attend the ball.
6660,capilouto11a,"Meanwhile, Cinderella dreams of the, you know, the, uh, everything that could possibly be, uh,."
6661,capilouto11a,"in going to this ball, not even necessarily thinking."
6662,capilouto11a,"about getting married to the prince, but just what could, you know, it could be so wondrous."
6663,capilouto11a,"And , uh,."
6664,capilouto11a,but she knows she doesn't have clothing suitable or anything else.
6665,capilouto11a,"Um, And , uh,."
6666,capilouto11a,in talking.
6667,capilouto11a,"with her animal friends, uh, they decide,."
6668,capilouto11a,in particular the mice decide.
6669,capilouto11a,"that they will make her a beautiful ball dress,."
6670,capilouto11a,and so they do.
6671,capilouto11a,"And she, uh, when, when it's time to leave."
6672,capilouto11a,"for the ball, uh, Cinderella appears with a stepmother."
6673,capilouto11a,with her stepsisters dressed in this beautiful ball dress and ready to go.
6674,capilouto11a,"Uh, they're."
6675,capilouto11a,They are very angry.
6676,capilouto11a,that she would have the effrontery to actually think.
6677,capilouto11a,"that she could go to the ball, being just a poor waitstaff at this point in her life."
6678,capilouto11a,"Uh,."
6679,capilouto11a,and so they destroy her dress.
6680,capilouto11a,and tear up her jewelry.
6681,capilouto11a,"that was prepared for her, um,."
6682,capilouto11a,"and leave her crying and ,."
6683,capilouto11a,and go off to the ball.
6684,capilouto11a,At.
6685,capilouto11a,"that point, uh, Cinderella, uh, has a fairy godmother, that 's where the fairy godmother enters into the story."
6686,capilouto11a,"Um, she, She talks with Cinderella,."
6687,capilouto11a,"and Cinderella says, of course,."
6688,capilouto11a,"that she does want to go through the wall,."
6689,capilouto11a,but she has no way.
6690,capilouto11a,"of getting there, no, no clothing suitable,."
6691,capilouto11a,"and so Cinderella, uh, the fairy godmother, uh, creates a beautiful white ball dress for Cinderella."
6692,capilouto11a,"and also creates out of a pumpkin, a, a, um, A cart and , and , uh, uh, along with horses,."
6693,capilouto11a,"and , uh, I believe one."
6694,capilouto11a,"of the mice gets turned into the, the driver for the, for , for the, Card."
6695,capilouto11a,And so off she goes to the ball.
6696,capilouto11a,"Uh, she, uh, enters, uh, into the ballroom."
6697,capilouto11a,and there's one.
6698,capilouto11a,"of the, there's a beautiful, uh, young woman."
6699,capilouto11a,"Uh, the prince dances with her."
6700,capilouto11a,and they have a lovely time.
6701,capilouto11a,But she realizes.
6702,capilouto11a,"that the, uh, she recognizes."
6703,capilouto11a,that her fairy godmother told her she must leave by midnight.
6704,capilouto11a,or everything will turn back into its former state.
6705,capilouto11a,Midnight is.
6706,capilouto11a,"about to, to strike,."
6707,capilouto11a,"and so she, uh, she's running out of the palace, running down the stairs."
6708,capilouto11a,"with the chancellor chasing after her, trying to get her name to find out who she is."
6709,capilouto11a,because the prince has fallen madly.
6710,capilouto11a,in love with her already.
6711,capilouto11a,"Um,."
6712,capilouto11a,"as she's dashing down the stairs, she leaves one of her slippers, which is made of glass."
6713,capilouto11a,"Uh,."
6714,capilouto11a,but she does get away.
6715,capilouto11a,before the chancellor can get her back into the carriage.
6716,capilouto11a,"and is transported back home, at which time everything comes back to, to normal, her normal life."
6717,capilouto11a,"Her, her clothing changes back into her old clothes and the, The chariot."
6718,capilouto11a,"or the, the, uh, cart becomes a, a pumpkin again."
6719,capilouto11a,"Um, After that time, the ball is over and the prince is just enchanted with this young woman he met."
6720,capilouto11a,and he wants to know who she is.
6721,capilouto11a,"All he has to tie her to, uh, to tie this, this missing person, uh, to the person he loves is this glass slipper,."
6722,capilouto11a,"and so he, he, um, His, uh, people from his palace leave."
6723,capilouto11a,"and they, they go through, throughout the entire town trying to find the young woman whose foot could fit into this glass slipper."
6724,capilouto11a,They go from house to house.
6725,capilouto11a,and no one can fit.
6726,capilouto11a,The feet are too small or too large.
6727,capilouto11a,None can fit.
6728,capilouto11a,until he gets to Cinderella's home.
6729,capilouto11a,"Of course, uh, the stepmother would like her foot tried out, uh,."
6730,capilouto11a,"but it doesn't fit,."
6731,capilouto11a,neither do the feet of the stepsisters.
6732,capilouto11a,"Um, they're about ready to leave when, uh, they realize."
6733,capilouto11a,"that there's another young woman present in the house, Cinderella."
6734,capilouto11a,The stepmother.
6735,capilouto11a,"and stepsisters tried to dissuade the, the, uh, courtiers from, from, uh, fitting the, the shoe to her foot,."
6736,capilouto11a,"but they insist,."
6737,capilouto11a,and find in fact it does fit.
6738,capilouto11a,"Um, They've finally located the woman that the prince is madly."
6739,capilouto11a,"in love with , uh,."
6740,capilouto11a,"and , uh, uh, shortly thereafter she is brought to the palace and they are, uh, married."
6741,capilouto11a,"and leaving off for a new life together in , Beautiful, uh, carriage."
6742,86-1,OK.
6743,86-1,"Um, Yeah, I didn't remember that first part."
6744,86-1,I Forget what where it looks like Cinderella.
6745,86-1,"Um, Father, maybe,."
6746,86-1,but I don't know.
6747,86-1,if he married another woman with um To Two girls.
6748,86-1,"I just, I remember Eil stepsisters, I think they are, maybe."
6749,86-1,"And Um, they don't like her cause she's pretty."
6750,86-1,And They make her do all the chores.
6751,86-1,"and Um, take care of everything."
6752,86-1,And uh I think the king is having a ball.
6753,86-1,And I forget how she gets invited.
6754,86-1,Or how she like or what the story is on why she goes.
6755,86-1,"and uh, I remember the ugly stepsisters went to."
6756,86-1,"Because she, uh she's got a fairy godmother that helps her get the dress and uh."
6757,86-1,"Uh, pumpkin carriage."
6758,86-1,"and the horses to take her to the palace for the ball, and at midnight."
6759,86-1,"Um, she runs away."
6760,86-1,because she's gonna turn back into a A servant girl.
6761,86-1,and she loses her glass slipper.
6762,86-1,And the prince wants to find her.
6763,86-1,So he has someone go around with the slipper to try.
6764,86-1,and See here with feds and uh.
6765,86-1,they try the stepsisters.
6766,86-1,"and it doesn't fit,."
6767,86-1,and they try Cinderella.
6768,86-1,"and it fits, and then He."
6769,86-1,and the prince lived happily ever after.
6770,neural27-1,OK.
6771,neural27-1,"Um, once upon a time, there was a girl named Cinderella."
6772,neural27-1,And Her father was going to marry.
6773,neural27-1,Another woman who had 2 daughters.
6774,neural27-1,"So , he brought her over to their house to meet them, and she was very excited to meet them, but the girls were not very excited and happy to meet her."
6775,neural27-1,"Um, they didn't want her because she was beautiful."
6776,neural27-1,"So , They were called the evil stepsisters."
6777,neural27-1,so the mom put Cinderella to work.
6778,neural27-1,while the girls just got to do whatever they wanted.
6779,neural27-1,Cinderella had to serve them tea.
6780,neural27-1,and bring them whatever they needed.
6781,neural27-1,"and do all the housework,."
6782,neural27-1,But she never complained.
6783,neural27-1,"and she just did it with, made friends with all the little animals,."
6784,neural27-1,"and she just went along her merry way until one day, the evil,."
6785,neural27-1,or the mom got a letter saying there was gonna be a ball.
6786,neural27-1,because I think the king.
6787,neural27-1,or the prince needed to find a wife.
6788,neural27-1,"And they were all so excited,."
6789,neural27-1,and Cinderella heard this invitation.
6790,neural27-1,and assumed she would get to go.
6791,neural27-1,So she went back to her room.
6792,neural27-1,and she got out of her chest of Stuff.
6793,neural27-1,and she got her dress out.
6794,neural27-1,"And she hung it up, and her."
6795,neural27-1,and the birds helped her make a beautiful dress.
6796,neural27-1,And she got all ready.
6797,neural27-1,"And at the same time, the stepsisters were getting all ready."
6798,neural27-1,"And when they all met to go to the ball, The stepsisters started ripping her dress."
6799,neural27-1,and Breaking her necklace.
6800,neural27-1,"and saying, you're not gonna go."
6801,neural27-1,so the mom said you can't go.
6802,neural27-1,"so the girls went off, the stepsisters,."
6803,neural27-1,"and went to the ball and Um, Cinderella was sad."
6804,neural27-1,"and , um, her fairy godmother appeared,."
6805,neural27-1,and she did her little magic with her wand.
6806,neural27-1,"and Made a carriage to take Cinderella into the ball,."
6807,neural27-1,"but before that, she did her magic."
6808,neural27-1,and gave her a beautiful white gown and some glass slippers to wear.
6809,neural27-1,So Cinderella got in the little carriage.
6810,neural27-1,She made it out of a pumpkin.
6811,neural27-1,And went to the ball.
6812,neural27-1,But the one thing was she had to be back by midnight.
6813,neural27-1,"if she wasn't, that's when everything was going to go back to what it was."
6814,neural27-1,Like her whole ripped dress and the carriage would be gone.
6815,neural27-1,"So , she was at the ball dancing with the prince,."
6816,neural27-1,"and she all of a sudden realized it was midnight,."
6817,neural27-1,"and the clock started chiming,."
6818,neural27-1,and she ran.
6819,neural27-1,"And when she was running down the steps to get to her carriage, her one of her glass slippers fell off."
6820,neural27-1,"So , she got in the carriage."
6821,neural27-1,"and it Went back home and then poof, she was with the animals in her old ripped dress,."
6822,neural27-1,and she went back to her house.
6823,neural27-1,"and um Then the next day, someone from the castle came with the glass slipper."
6824,neural27-1,because they wanted to find who the shoe fit.
6825,neural27-1,And the stepsisters had huge feet.
6826,neural27-1,and they wouldn't fit into the glass slipper.
6827,neural27-1,"and they did not want Cinderella to try it on,."
6828,neural27-1,but she did.
6829,neural27-1,And the glass slipper fit her.
6830,neural27-1,"So , They took her to the castle to be with the prince,."
6831,neural27-1,and they lived happily ever after.
6832,03-1,Cinderella.
6833,03-1,was A girl when her mother died.
6834,03-1,Her name was Ella.
6835,03-1,And She.
6836,03-1,and her father had a very happy life.
6837,03-1,"Mostly,."
6838,03-1,but I guess he needed to remarry.
6839,03-1,So then he remarried.
6840,03-1,and his new wife had two daughters of her own.
6841,03-1,"So when she moved in, she decided that Ella should be the one to do all the cleaning, and it was back in the days when they had fires, so she had to clean the fireplace,."
6842,03-1,and she ended up with cinders all the time.
6843,03-1,So I ended up calling her Cinderella.
6844,03-1,That 's how she came to have the name Cinderella.
6845,03-1,"Um, and the sisters were not even very nice to her."
6846,03-1,"They, they, they kind of, they, they were envious because she was naturally beautiful."
6847,03-1,"and they had, uh, less, less conventional conventionally attractive appearance, and um."
6848,03-1,"Eventually She got an opportunity, I think with a fairy godmother to go to a ball."
6849,03-1,and um so she ended up.
6850,03-1,"like with lots of supernatural help, getting really dressed up."
6851,03-1,and riding in a coach made out of a pumpkin.
6852,03-1,"and wearing shoes made out of glass, highly, highly improbable,."
6853,03-1,but she had a blast.
6854,03-1,"Uh, the only caveat was she needed to Be finished."
6855,03-1,She need to be finished by midnight.
6856,03-1,"because when the clock struck 12, boom, um, she was no longer going to be all the, all the magic went away at midnight."
6857,03-1,So she was.
6858,03-1,"like , running away, running away, running away at midnight."
6859,03-1,"as the clock struck 12, the only thing left was one glass slipper."
6860,03-1,So then the prince was.
6861,03-1,like going all over the kingdom trying to fit.
6862,03-1,The glass slipper onto uh everybody's everybody's feet.
6863,03-1,"And of course, nobody, her family didn't know she had snuck away."
6864,03-1,and got to do this.
6865,03-1,So they were.
6866,03-1,"like , no, no, no, don't even let, don't even let, don't let Cinderella try that on."
6867,03-1,And the prince was.
6868,03-1,"like , no, no, everybody, everybody has to try this little beautiful tiny glass slipper on, um,."
6869,03-1,"and in the, in the original version, I don't know."
6870,03-1,"if you've heard the original version, it was horrible."
6871,03-1,They.
6872,03-1,like did the the sisters.
6873,03-1,like cut their toes off to fit in the anyway.
6874,03-1,"Um, so, yeah, Cinderella, of course, had the perfect size foot."
6875,03-1,She slipped it on.
6876,03-1,and uh they lived happily ever after.
6877,07-1,"Well, the story of Cinderella is the sad story about a, a young girl whose father marries uh, a, a lady, uh."
6878,07-1,"With two children, uh, that are, uh, not nice."
6879,07-1,"neither is she,."
6880,07-1,"and they make her do all the skul adultery in the house and cleaning and all,."
6881,07-1,"and , uh Uh, Let's say her father must die."
6882,07-1,and then she's left with them.
6883,07-1,"and she does all the work, uh."
6884,07-1,"Then they have a uh They have a They sent out in the, in the country a notice."
6885,07-1,that the prince is looking for a wife.
6886,07-1,"And so they're, they're gonna have him come to a ball."
6887,07-1,"Gosh, I'm almost forgetting it."
6888,07-1,"I'll come to a ball and ,."
6889,07-1,"and she goes to the ball,."
6890,07-1,and uh she doesn't get to go to the ball.
6891,07-1,"because the, the uh The stepmother who is wicked has not allowed her to,."
6892,07-1,and she has to get everybody else ready.
6893,07-1,But her little friends and the mice.
6894,07-1,"and whatever little animals are there, make her a dress, uh,."
6895,07-1,and She puts it on to go to the ball.
6896,07-1,and she does go to the ball.
6897,07-1,"And uh when she gets there, she has glass slippers and a beautiful dress,."
6898,07-1,"and the prince dances with her,."
6899,07-1,but she loses one of her slippers when it strikes 12.
6900,07-1,and she has to go home.
6901,07-1,"because her fairy godmother had created a pumpkin coach for her and ,."
6902,07-1,and made sure.
6903,07-1,that she had everything.
6904,07-1,"that she needed and uh Uh, horseman, the driver, and the, the, the, uh, horse and , and a beautiful carriage when she clicked her wand."
6905,07-1,And she went to the ball.
6906,07-1,"and I, I'm, I'm regressing, sorry."
6907,07-1,"But when she gets there, she does dance with him."
6908,07-1,and she loses the slipper.
6909,07-1,as she runs down the step.
6910,07-1,because it's.
6911,07-1,like striking 12.
6912,07-1,and she has to get home.
6913,07-1,because the coach will turn into a pumpkin again.
6914,07-1,"and the, the mice will turn, the horse will turn into mice, and I'm not sure what the, I think he's a dog."
6915,07-1,that the coachman turns into.
6916,07-1,But she gets home.
6917,07-1,and then they find the slipper.
6918,07-1,and then there's a crew.
6919,07-1,that goes out.
6920,07-1,"that they're coming to all the homes to see who the slipper belongs to,."
6921,07-1,"but the wicked stepmother will not let her participate and he, she,."
6922,07-1,"and in the picture, it showed."
6923,07-1,that she tripped the little guy.
6924,07-1,that was carrying the slipper on her.
6925,07-1,"On a pillow,."
6926,07-1,but apparently she does get it fitted.
6927,07-1,"and uh he takes her, I guess, back."
6928,07-1,and the prince realizes that she was the one that was in the ball.
6929,07-1,and they have a ball and a wedding.
6930,07-1,And they live happily ever after.
6931,wright06a,"There, there, there was, um, a daughter and her father, Stepmother."
6932,wright06a,With her too.
6933,wright06a,Daughters.
6934,wright06a,"Apparently, he passed away."
6935,wright06a,"and the daughter, His daughter was left with a step, Two stepsisters."
6936,wright06a,They used to.
6937,wright06a,as a She befriended Ollie.
6938,wright06a,house.
6939,wright06a,dreamt.
6940,wright06a,of going to the ball.
6941,wright06a,But she didn't have anything nice to wear.
6942,wright06a,And her fairy godmother.
6943,wright06a,Appeared.
6944,wright06a,Beautiful gown.
6945,wright06a,Was the burst.
6946,wright06a,into the ball.
6947,wright06a,The stepmother.
6948,wright06a,and uh stepsisters didn't know.
6949,wright06a,"That this happened and at the ball, she,."
6950,wright06a,But at midnight she had to leave.
6951,wright06a,She was Back.

6964,94-1,"OK,."
6965,94-1,"so there was this beautiful young girl, Cinderella, and she was like the pride of her father."

6969,94-1,"and You know, in the beginning, they think everything's gonna be nice, we're all gonna be sisters together,."
6970,94-1,but it's soon gonna get denigrates where the stepmother is pushing ahead her two daughters.

6972,94-1,And she makes her wait on them.
6973,94-1,"and clean the floor and ,."

6993,94-1,"Well, of course, this, the wicked stepmother is anxious for her daughters to go and to, to be the one picked."
6994,94-1,"She doesn't want Cinderella even to know about it, whatever."
6995,94-1,So she hides it from her.
6996,94-1,"Well, OK, so ,?"
6997,94-1,"so the stepsisters are getting there and their dresses ready,?"
6998,94-1,and somehow Cinderella finds the story that uh that About this ball?

7029,94-1,"and what happened to her,."
7030,94-1,"but they find the glass slipper on the steps,."
7031,94-1,"so they send like a king's uh consultant or courtier or courtier or whatever, um, around with the glass slipper slipper,."

7044,35-1,"and don't know where the father is, but stepmother."
7045,35-1,"Um, and she is, all the housecleaning burdens."

7050,35-1,"because she doesn't have any clothes, um."
7051,35-1,And so a fairy godmother comes.
7052,35-1,and helps her.
7053,35-1,and creates a gown for her.
7054,35-1,"and uh takes a pumpkin, turns it into a carriage and a mouse into a foot, a foot, footman on the um thing."

7058,35-1,cause everything's going to disappear.
7059,35-1,"and um She sees it's almost midnight, so she runs out,."
7060,35-1,"but when she does, she drops her shoe."

7062,35-1,"and the prince takes that shoe around to the village to see who it would fit in,."
7063,35-1,"and when he gets to Cinderella, the home that Cinderella's in, um, it fits her,."
7064,35-1,and they live happily ever after.

7071,capilouto08a,"She waits on the, the daughters and the mother, hand and foot, cleaning, picking up after them, trying to take care of the cat, which has little horns on it."
7072,capilouto08a,Um-hum.
7073,capilouto08a,And the cat doesn't like it at all.
7074,capilouto08a,"Well, Cinderella, there's the big ball, annual ball coming up at the castle."
7075,capilouto08a,"And the king has, Raised holy Cain with his Son."

7087,capilouto08a,and how they're going to dress and what they're going to put on and this.
7088,capilouto08a,And they squabble.

7090,capilouto08a,and fight among themselves.
7091,capilouto08a,"And in the meantime, Cinderella looks at one of the gowns."

7107,capilouto08a,"and the fairy godmother is not going to let anything upset their, her plans."
7108,capilouto08a,or Cinderella is going to have a good time.

7142,capilouto08a,that one shoe wouldn't fit her.
7143,capilouto08a,"Of course, they know that ,."
7144,capilouto08a,"that shoe does,."
7145,capilouto08a,because they've seen her wearing it.
7146,capilouto08a,That wouldn't fit her.
7147,capilouto08a,"And he says, well, I must insist."
7148,capilouto08a,The prince has told me.

7154,capilouto08a,and all ends in love and happiness.
7155,wright08a,"It's a story of a um A wicked woman with two, With two daughters."
7156,wright08a,OK.
7157,wright08a,"This, um, this girl, OK, the point where it starts is they're, um, the girls are young,."
7158,wright08a,"and then Cinderella comes to live with them, and she's young too."
7159,wright08a,"And these are the, uh, wicked stepsisters and wicked stepmother."
7160,wright08a,"And she's very, um, very poor, and they're very mean to her."
7161,wright08a,And there's going to be a ball.
7162,wright08a,"and so she longs to go to the ball,."
7163,wright08a,but she's told she can't go to the ball.
7164,wright08a,"So they, they go."
7165,wright08a,and um she is granted um a wish from mystery.
7166,wright08a,"The surname, uh, the fairy godmother."
7167,wright08a,And um.
7168,wright08a,"that she could go to the ball,."
7169,wright08a,"but she would have to be back by midnight, so she, you know, has the magic wand."
7170,wright08a,"and she gives,."
7171,wright08a,"and she, um she's dressed in this beautiful dress."
7172,wright08a,and she dances with Prince Charming.
7173,wright08a,"while the wicked stepsisters are looking in, you know, in horror and anger."
7174,wright08a,"and so when it strikes, um, midnight, she has to get into this carriage."
7175,wright08a,And be home.
7176,wright08a,"But She, in the meantime, she's rushing so fast, she, she drops one of her shoes, so she goes home."
7177,wright08a,"and meanwhile, Prince Charming is trying,."
7178,wright08a,"and then she's transformed into with the poor, you know, dress and everything."
7179,wright08a,"Meanwhile, he is trying to find who the shoe belonged to."
7180,wright08a,"because he wanted to be back with her to live happily ever after,."
7181,wright08a,"and the shoe fits Cinderella,."
7182,wright08a,and they live happily ever after.
7183,wright08a,OK.
7184,wright08a,OK.
7185,wright08a,You are done.
7186,wright08a,Oh great.
7187,279-1,"OK, so the story of Cinderella."
7188,279-1,"Cinderella, apparently her father remarried."
7189,279-1,and so she became the stepdaughter to her new mother.
7190,279-1,And so the new mother had two other daughters that were very mean to Cinderella.
7191,279-1,They didn't like her.
7192,279-1,"Cinderella was beautiful, so the stepmother had Cinderella."
7193,279-1,"to clean the ashes in the chimney,."
7194,279-1,"if I recall correctly, that 's why she got the name Cinder."
7195,279-1,and ended up being Cinderella.
7196,279-1,"So she was doing all the dirty work on at at the house,."
7197,279-1,and so it so happened that the king.
7198,279-1,"or was given a ball for his son, the prince."
7199,279-1,And he had invited all the ladies in the nation or in that kingdom.
7200,279-1,"to come to the ball, and the mean stepsisters were so mean, they were preparing."
7201,279-1,"to go to the ball,."
7202,279-1,"but Cinderella again, was relegated."
7203,279-1,to cleaning the house.
7204,279-1,and helping them get dressed.
7205,279-1,and beautifying them.
7206,279-1,"and helping them, as a result, She was a little saddened."
7207,279-1,that she wasn't gonna be able.
7208,279-1,"to go to the ball,."
7209,279-1,but I'm trying.
7210,279-1,to remember who was it.
7211,279-1,that convinced her.
7212,279-1,to go to the ball.
7213,279-1,"I can't remember,."
7214,279-1,"but in the meantime, she decided somehow through someone."
7215,279-1,that she was going.
7216,279-1,"to go to the ball, and so as a result, She got this beautiful gown, I don't know."
7217,279-1,"if she made it,."
7218,279-1,or she took the one of the sister's gown.
7219,279-1,and put it into action or whatever.
7220,279-1,"Oh no, it was, I think it was the, the fairy godmother, the, the nice lady, the witch, not the witch, but the fairy godmother."
7221,279-1,that convinced her.
7222,279-1,to go to the ball.
7223,279-1,if I remember correctly.
7224,279-1,"But anyways,."
7225,279-1,"to make a long story short, so Cinderella got ready."
7226,279-1,to go to the ball.
7227,279-1,"and she needed, she had these slippers of somehow the slippers appeared somewhere."
7228,279-1,"I, I can't recall exactly how they appeared,."
7229,279-1,"but anyway, she wore these nice little beautiful slippers to the ball."
7230,279-1,"This coach, um, um, this, oh yes, it was the, the, the, the, the, the, not the witch but the nice, the good ferret."
7231,279-1,that converted this pumpkin into a coach.
7232,279-1,"And the horses, she gave us some horses,."
7233,279-1,and I think she was the one who used her wand.
7234,279-1,"to create the, the, the slippers."
7235,279-1,that Cinderella was.
7236,279-1,"to wear,."
7237,279-1,"and I think the gown also,."
7238,279-1,and eventually Cinderella went to the ball.
7239,279-1,"and this coach, she stepped out."
7240,279-1,and she went into the ball.
7241,279-1,And she was afraid.
7242,279-1,"that her stepsisters would recognize her,."
7243,279-1,"but they did not,."
7244,279-1,but she went to the ball.
7245,279-1,"and she just mingled with the crowd, and she was the most beautiful person there."
7246,279-1,"When the press saw spotted her, he wanted."
7247,279-1,"to dance with her, but all these other ladies that were there, as well."
7248,279-1,as the stepsisters were vying for his attention.
7249,279-1,because he was looking for a wife.
7250,279-1,to marry.
7251,279-1,"As a result, he ended up dancing with Cinderella, and Cinderella was so into the dance,."
7252,279-1,but she knew she had.
7253,279-1,to leave the ball by 12 o'clock.
7254,279-1,"So,."
7255,279-1,as she was dancing.
7256,279-1,and she heard the the toll or the clock tick that it was time.
7257,279-1,"to leave, so she had."
7258,279-1,to exit real fast.
7259,279-1,So.
7260,279-1,"as she was running down the steps, she lost one of her beautiful glass slippers."
7261,279-1,"And so she got in the coach, and just."
7262,279-1,"before she made it home, the coach had turned to a pumpkin,."
7263,279-1,and the horses had turned.
7264,279-1,"to , I forget what they were at the beginning."
7265,279-1,That was pulling the the the the chariot.
7266,279-1,So Cinderella made it home before the stepsisters.
7267,279-1,"and she, when she heard them come in, they were talking about the ball."
7268,279-1,and what had happened and the fact.
7269,279-1,"that the prince had picked up this, this, this, this slip, no, he didn't know, they didn't know."
7270,279-1,that he had picked up the slipper.
7271,279-1,that she left behind.
7272,279-1,"But anyways, a couple of days."
7273,279-1,"or weeks later, the prince made the announcement."
7274,279-1,that he was looking for the woman.
7275,279-1,"that had left the slipper behind, so he had sent his Entourage throughout the city looking for."
7276,279-1,to see.
7277,279-1,"if anyone could fit that slipper, what woman feet could fit into that slipper,."
7278,279-1,"and so he visited this place that all where all the women were,."
7279,279-1,but he couldn't find anyone.
7280,279-1,and then he went to Cinderella's home.
7281,279-1,"and her step sisters tried,."
7282,279-1,but it didn't fit to them.
7283,279-1,I think a lot of women tried.
7284,279-1,"to squash their feet into it,."
7285,279-1,but somehow Cinderella ended up trying.
7286,279-1,to slip her on.
7287,279-1,And the person knew that was the woman.
7288,279-1,"that he had danced with,."
7289,279-1,and so I guess it ended in a fairy tale.
7290,279-1,They lived happily ever after.
7291,279-1,"I forgot how they got back together,."
7292,279-1,but they lived happily ever after.
7293,279-1,And so that 's why I recall the story of Cinderella.
