244-1,"So this is a long story, and this is the Disney version and not the Brothers Grimm version."
244-1,"So once upon a time, there was a very happy family with one little girl named Cinderella."
244-1,The mother had died.
244-1,"before the story starts,."
244-1,and the father wanted to Marry again.
244-1,that Cinderella would have a stepmother.
244-1,"So he did,."
244-1,"and he married this woman whose name I don't remember,."
244-1,but she also had two daughters named Anastasia and Rosella.
244-1,"And then the book did not tell us, but at this point it's important."
244-1,that the father dies.
244-1,because he has to be out of the picture.
244-1,Didn't show me a picture of father dying.
244-1,So the mother really does not like Cinderella at all.
244-1,and starts to treat Cinderella if she were a servant.
244-1,When Cinderella has to do all the cleaning.
244-1,"and she wears dirty clothes,."
244-1,and there they talk about the fact.
244-1,"that she has to clean out the fireplace, hence Cinderella, and Anastasia and Drissella are mean to her."
244-1,And um that 's why the father has to be dead.
244-1,So then we see the king who's a rather blustery man saying my son has to marry the prince really needs a wife.
244-1,Would he please settle down?
244-1,and get a wife?
244-1,"We're going to have a ball where he can meet all the young women in the kingdom,."
244-1,and then he better choose a wife.
244-1,cause really we need him to get married.
244-1,So the invitation to the ball comes to the stepmother.
244-1,and um it says all the young maidens must come to the ball.
244-1,"so Cinderella goes, God, this is great."
244-1,"I'm gonna be able to go and then stepmother's like , yeah, mhm, sure."
244-1,So It probably wasn't in the book.
244-1,So actually the stepmother says.
244-1,"if you get all your work done, you can go, knowing full well."
244-1,that they were gonna put all sorts of work on her.
244-1,that would make it.
244-1,so she couldn't go.
244-1,"She also had nothing to wear, so the mice, including Gus,."
244-1,"if you've seen the movie Gus Gus, Gus, Gus, Gus, the mice."
244-1,and the birds make a beautiful gown for her.
244-1,So she gets all her work done.
244-1,Anastasia.
244-1,"and Drissella are really making her get them ready, zip me up, tighten my corset, comb my hair, put my bow in my hair,."
244-1,"and they get all ready,."
244-1,and then Cinderella goes.
244-1,and puts her beautiful gown on that the birds.
244-1,and the mice have made for her.
244-1,The family is loading into their carriage.
244-1,and Cinderella comes out in this really very nice gown.
244-1,And Anastasia.
244-1,"and Drissella, go nuts, rip the gown apart, make fun of Cinderella."
244-1,Make her.
244-1,and go off without her.
244-1,and she's left in tears.
244-1,But her fairy godmother appears.
244-1,"and said, Cinderella, you really, you're gonna be going to the ball."
244-1,"You don't want me to sing the song, do you?"
244-1,Salaadula Mgabula bibbity bodi boo.
244-1,She sings a song with the magic.
244-1,Put them together?
244-1,and what have you got?
244-1,ibbity bo boo.
244-1,There's more.
244-1,"Um,."
244-1,while she's doing.
244-1,"that , she sprinkles the fairy dust around, the fairy godmother dust around,."
244-1,and Cinderella gets a beautiful new gown.
244-1,"She turns a pumpkin into a carriage, turns the mice into footmen."
244-1,And she gives her some beautiful shoes?
244-1,that can you imagine are made of glass?
244-1,Comfortable?
244-1,I think not.
244-1,So she goes off to the ball.
244-1,The carriage.
244-1,and the footman deliver.
244-1,"Oh, the fairy godmother says,."
244-1,but you have to be done by midnight.
244-1,You have to be home by midnight.
244-1,The magic wears off at midnight.
244-1,"So Cinderella goes to the ball, she walks in."
244-1,and the prince is smitten.
244-1,He's seen every other girl at the ball.
244-1,that are really preening.
244-1,"and preening for him, but this is the girl for him."
244-1,They dance a few dances.
244-1,and then they go out on the balcony.
244-1,"In the Disney version, they don't do a little smooching,."
244-1,but you never know.
244-1,Suddenly she hears the clock starting to ring 12.
244-1,"She goes, oh, it's 12 o'clock."
244-1,I've got to go.
244-1,She runs away from him.
244-1,She runs down the pallet stairs.
244-1,"and one of her silver, one of her shoes falls off."
244-1,"She runs into the carriage, they take off and at the end of midnight."
244-1,The carriage turns back into a pumpkin.
244-1,She's in her rags again.
244-1,"The footmen are mice again,."
244-1,"but oddly, the glass slippers have not turned back into shoes."
244-1,"Don't know why the magic on the slippers did not end at midnight,."
244-1,but the story wouldn't work without.
244-1,"So the prince really, really wants this girl."
244-1,"Nobody knows her name, and Anastasia."
244-1,and Grisella did not recognize her.
244-1,"because she was all looking, not."
244-1,like she had smudges on her face.
244-1,or wearing rags.
244-1,"So they start going, the prince and his."
244-1,Helpers start going door to door to find the girl.
244-1,that fits into the glass slipper.
244-1,When he arrives at their house.
244-1,Cinderella is not allowed to come up to the front where the prince is.
244-1,"Anastasia tries it on, Drusilla tries it on."
244-1,"They have big ugly feet, it."
244-1,so doesn't fit.
244-1,"And in the brothers Grim version, they hack off their toes and their heels,."
244-1,and they still don't fit.
244-1,But Disney doesn't hack off toes and heels.
244-1,Somehow Cinderella manages to Get into the living room.
244-1,"that it fits, he loves her, they get married,."
244-1,and of course they live happily ever after.
244-1,Let's move on to something a little different.
244-1,This is a long story.
244-1,That is true.
244-1,Tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
244-1,"So when I'm cooking, I."
244-1,"like to get everything out first,."
244-1,"so I get out the loaf of bread, and it's probably whole wheat bread, and the jar of peanut butter, which in our case is chunky peanut butter and jelly could be any one of the jellies we have in the fridge and the knife."
244-1,"Um, open the bread, take out two pieces of bread, lay them flat on the counter."
244-1,Close up the bread thing.
244-1,and it will go put away.
244-1,"So , open the peanut butter jar."
244-1,and take the knife.
244-1,and spread the peanut butter.
46-1,"OK, Cinderella."
46-1,"Is uh Sort of a maid, I would say."
46-1,And she As In a house with 2.
46-1,I guess they're sisters.
46-1,They make her work and clean.
46-1,"and Really, uh, trigger real well."
46-1,So They should have made it.
46-1,The family gets invited to a ball.
46-1,And uh Cinderella's not invited.
46-1,She meets up with somebody that advise her to go to the ball.
46-1,And she Meets a fairy godmother who gives her a gun.
46-1,She goes to the ball.
46-1,And uh she meets her prince.
46-1,And she has on these glass slippers.
46-1,"Maybe, I don't know, glass or fancy lip."
46-1,"And uh she has to be home by 12 o'clock or 11 o'clock, something like that."
46-1,So she's leaving.
46-1,The prince don't want her to leave.
46-1,and she loses one of her slippers.
46-1,"And uh The next day He guys looking for you, he has a slipper."
46-1,Or somebody finds a slipper.
46-1,and takes it.
46-1,and it fits her foot.
46-1,So she ends up with a prince and a.
46-1,"Uh, carriage, it was a pump."
46-1,"Or something like that, that's the way I remember."
neural29-1,"Well, There once was a time that Cinderella and her two sisters and her evil mother."
neural29-1,Oh They lived Near a kingdom where.
neural29-1,The king lived and his.
neural29-1,"Son, which was the prince."

neural29-1,"Um, The letter came from the king and they."
neural29-1,Mother told Cinderella she had to stay home.
neural29-1,and clean the house.
neural29-1,She wasn't allowed to go to the to the ball.
neural29-1,"She was, I think, the ugly sister."
neural29-1,Or the sister.
neural29-1,that didn't belong.
neural29-1,"Um, So the mother and the tube."
neural29-1,Sisters went to the ball.
neural29-1,Cinderella.
neural29-1,Decided.
neural29-1,that she was going to go to the ball.
neural29-1,She got her beautiful dress on.
neural29-1,and The fairy godmother showed up.
neural29-1,"and Turned her pumpkin and her rodents into a stagecoach, a pumpkin."
neural29-1,With horses.
neural29-1,"Cinderella went to the ball, and her sisters and mother were very upset why she showed up to the ball."
neural29-1,"Prince saw her, fell in love with her, first sight."
neural29-1,"They ended up dancing The When the clock struck 12, she would turn back into."
neural29-1,Cinderella with.
neural29-1,"No Beautiful dress, the pumpkin."
neural29-1,or the stagecoach would shrink back to a pumpkin.
neural29-1,And the animals would go back to from horses to rodents.
neural29-1,"Um, the prince was very upset he couldn't find Cinderella."
neural29-1,Cinderella ran out the door.
neural29-1,She lost her slipper.
neural29-1,"Um, Or her shoe."
neural29-1,and The prince found it on the boardwalk.
neural29-1,And he Wanted to find out where this woman went to.

neural29-1,In the city.
neural29-1,"Finally, she, he finds Cinderella."
neural29-1,And the mothers and the daughters were so appalled.
neural29-1,Once He found Cinderella.
neural29-1,He made her his queen.
neural29-1,that 's about it.
221-1,"Um, Cinderella, uh, lived in a home with two stepsisters, um,."
221-1,"so she was kind of considered the, the third and not really equal to them."
221-1,"Um, a big party."

221-1,So they were all excited.
221-1,"and got new dresses and ,."
221-1,"and getting ready to go to the ball,."
221-1,while Cinderella was sweeping up.
221-1,and still having to work.
221-1,"Um, somehow, uh, I don't know who appeared to her or whatever."
221-1,"I don't remember this part,."
221-1,but she gave her clicked her wand and Cinderella somehow.
221-1,"I can't remember now how Cinderella got to go to the ball,."
221-1,"but so she went to the ball, um,."
221-1,"but she had to leave before midnight,."
221-1,or her carriage was gonna turn into a pumpkin.
221-1,"And , uh,."
221-1,so she went.
221-1,and had a great time at the ball.
221-1,and danced.
221-1,"and met some charming fellow guy,."
221-1,"and he fell in love with her,."
221-1,"and all of a sudden she realized what time it was,."
221-1,"and she ran to catch her carriage home,."
221-1,"so it wouldn't turn into a pumpkin,."

221-1,"and his shoe didn't fit,."
221-1,and then he tried it on Cinderella and the shoe.

08-1,Yeah The birds helped Cinderella.
08-1,by bringing ribbons.

08-1,"Cinderella remembered, oh my."
08-1,The fairy godmother told her.
08-1,"that this magic, this spell would only last until midnight,."
08-1,and I had to leave by midnight.
08-1,and go home.
08-1,So she left the prince.
08-1,and ran to the entrance.
08-1,and was running down the steps.
08-1,"and the prince said, wait, wait, stop."
08-1,I don't even know your name.

08-1,The poor prince was left standing there.
08-1,He saw the glass slipper.
08-1,"and thought, oh my, maybe I can use this glass slipper to figure out who this lady was."
08-1,So the prince ordered a search of the kingdom.
08-1,"Find this lady, uh, all the young women."
08-1,"I, I need to meet, I need to see, I need to find out."
08-1,and this glass slipper will be the the key.

08-1,"And his men were going house to house in the kingdom, everyone trying on the glass slipper who looked."
08-1,like they might.

08-1,And no one had a foot delicate enough to fit into that glass slipper.
08-1,"Uh, he finally came to the home of Cinderella and her stepfamily."
08-1,"And her mother had her two ugly stepsisters try on the slipper,."
08-1,"but their feet wouldn't even go in the shoe, not at all."
08-1,And the prince knew they obviously weren't the lady he was looking for anyway.
08-1,"Uh,?"
08-1,"so he asked, is there anyone else in the house?"
08-1,"Oh, we have a maid upstairs,."
08-1,but she didn't go to the party.
08-1,and the prince said.
08-1,I want to meet her.

08-1,like her to try on the slipper.
08-1,so The stepmom.

276-1,"He ends up, he marries Cinderella and her stepsisters and her stepmother."
276-1,"Uh, it are frowned upon by the royalty,."

101-1,And the stepmother is not very nice to this little girl.
101-1,"and makes her do all the cleaning in the house, doesn't let her get dressed up, doesn't let her go to parties."
101-1,Her sisters are very mean to her.
101-1,"One day the prince of the town, village, country, wherever it happens to be."
101-1,"that she's in, um, decides to have a ball because it's time."
101-1,for him to find a girlfriend or wife.
101-1,So they send invitations out throughout the land.
101-1,"and an invitation comes to Cinderella's house and her stepsisters are all happy about it and her stepmothers all happy about it,."
101-1,"and they say, well of course they can go,."
101-1,"but you, Cinderella cannot go."
101-1,"Um, so her sisters get dressed, they go off to the party."
101-1,"Cinderella is feeling very sad,."
101-1,"but she's, she has a lot of friends in the, um, animal world,."
101-1,"and they help make her, um."
101-1,They don't help her make a dress.
101-1,"She somehow is crying or whatever,."
101-1,and her fairy godmother comes.
101-1,and whips up this gorgeous dress for her.
101-1,and the little animals become the footman and the the pages and the people.
101-1,that will help her get ready for the ball.
101-1,"and we'll take her to the ball coachman, um,."
101-1,and the carriage is made out of a pumpkin.
101-1,"before she leaves her fairy godmother says you can have all this fun, but you must be back by the stroke of midnight that 's when all the magic goes."
101-1,and the mice become mice.
101-1,So Cinderella goes to the ball and she's absolutely stunning.
101-1,and her stepsisters notice.
101-1,"that there's this beautiful girl there,."
101-1,but um they don't recognize their shaggy looking little stepsister.
101-1,And the prince sees her and of course she's absolutely lovely.
101-1,"and the prince goes up and dances with her, but being The prince, he's not too bright,."
101-1,and he doesn't get her name and her address.
101-1,"So all of a sudden, the clock strikes 12."
101-1,Cinderella realizes.
101-1,that she's got to get home.
101-1,before everything changes back.
101-1,"She goes running down the steps of the castle,."
101-1,"as she's running, she loses one of her beautiful glass slippers, which."
101-1,"for some reason doesn't change back, even."
101-1,though all the rest of her clothes do.
101-1,"She get back, gets back to her place, her, her stepsisters come back."
101-1,They had a great time.
101-1,"Um, the next day the prince's footman, um,."
101-1,"and the prince go door to door to see who fits this tiny little glass slipper,."
101-1,and her sisters all tried on.
101-1,and of course they have big old feet.
101-1,and they don't fit.
101-1,"And um Cinderella says, well, wait, let me try it on,."
101-1,and she comes down.
101-1,"and it fits perfectly,."
101-1,and her sisters are all pissed off.
101-1,"and her stepmothers all pissed off, um, but the prince, although he's dumb, he's very sweet,."
101-1,"and he says, oh, this is perfect, the shoe fits, you're pretty, let's get married."
101-1,and we will live happily ever after.
101-1,that is the Disney version.
233-1,apparently married a second wife.
233-1,and who had 3 daughters.
233-1,that she doted on.
233-1,And Cinderella was left to do all the chores.
233-1,while the dollars were living in luxury.
233-1,But then there was an announcement from the palace.
233-1,"that there was going to be a ball, and the sisters are so excited."
233-1,about getting new gowns.
233-1,and getting all dressed up to go to the ball.
233-1,But they won't let Cinderella go.
233-1,because she doesn't have the clothes to wear.
233-1,So the the stepsisters get all dressed.
233-1,and they go off to the ball leaving Cinderella at home.
233-1,"And ,."
233-1,"but , Cinderella's fairy godmother comes with her little mice."
233-1,And gets her all dressed up in a nice ball gown.
233-1,A special carriage.
233-1,"And the horsemen are the horses, I think the mice become the horsemen horses in this."
233-1,"But anyway, so she goes off to the ball."
233-1,"In her beautiful white dress, she dances with the prince."
233-1,"He falls madly in love with her,."
233-1,"but she has to be out of there by midnight, so on the way down the steps leaving, she loses her glass slipper."
233-1,And the prince takes the glass slipper.
233-1,and tries it to fit it on the women in the town where they live in his kingdom.
233-1,"And all those women, they want him to, you know, find them."
233-1,and marry them.
233-1,and make them a princess.
233-1,Then he comes to Cinderella and the last you.
39-1,"Well, this is the Walt Disney Cinderella story."
39-1,"um,."
39-1,so all the characters are based on the story.
39-1,that Walt Disney has created.
39-1,Cinderella was a girl living with her father in a nice mansion.
39-1,"Um, her father, I don't know what happened to her mother, but it was just her father who married another woman who became her stepmother, who had two daughters who became Cinderella's stepsisters."
39-1,"Well, the father passed away,."
39-1,and the stepmother took over rule of the castle and everything else.
39-1,that they lived in.
39-1,"because her the stepmother valued the her own daughters over Cinderella, Cinderella became more or less a slave to the stepmother and the stepsister's wishes, which is why her name became Cinderella,."
39-1,because she toiled.
39-1,"and stayed in the kitchen near the cinders, which got all over her clothes most of the time when she was working."
39-1,"One day, the prince, um, was in the castle,."
39-1,"and his father, the king, decided it was time for the prince to marry."
39-1,So the only way he could find a suitable wife.
39-1,for Cinderella was decided to throw a big ball.
39-1,and invite every young maiden in the whole area to come.
39-1,"and meet the prince,."
39-1,and the prince would select a suitable prospective wife.
39-1,So they sent out letters far and wide for every young maiden.
39-1,The stepmother was thrilled with this.
39-1,because she was sending her own two daughters.
39-1,and was dressing them in the finest dresses she could find.
39-1,"for them, sparing no expense."
39-1,"Cinderella, however, begged to go to the ball,."
39-1,but the stepmother said no.
39-1,"because Cinderella did not have a dress,."
39-1,and she would not provide a dress for Cinderella.
39-1,"So , Cinderella went into an old trunk."
39-1,and found a very pretty pink dress.
39-1,"that was owned by her mother,."
39-1,but it didn't fit quite right.
39-1,"So Cinderella started to alter the dress with the help of two of the Couple of the mice from the kitchen, um, Zach,."
39-1,"and I'm trying to remember the other names,."
39-1,"cause I thought I knew them, were helping her to do the dress,."
39-1,"and they were singing, Let's make a dress for Cinderella."
39-1,so the dress looked beautiful.
39-1,"However, when it came time to go to the ball, the stepsisters came down."
39-1,and were dressed very beautifully.
39-1,And Cinderella came down in her dress.
39-1,"Well, the stepmother was enraged that Cinderella was able to find a dress."
39-1,So between the stepmother.
39-1,"and the stepsisters, they destroyed the dress."
39-1,and poor Cinderella could not go to the ball.
39-1,"So ,."
39-1,as she sat crying.
39-1,"because she couldn't go to the ball, lo."
39-1,"and behold, a wonderful woman appeared, known as her fairy godmother,."
39-1,"and said, Not to worry, we will get you to the ball."
39-1,"And Bippity boppity boo,."
39-1,"if you want, I'll sing the whole song,."
39-1,but I won't do that right now.
39-1,"Um,."
39-1,"so she provided a very beautiful dress for Cinderella, Blue, um, with sparkles, um."
39-1,And had Cinderella's hair all done up.
39-1,"Well,?"
39-1,"but Cinderella could go to the ball dressed like this with beautiful glass slippers,?"
39-1,but how could she get there?
39-1,"So , the fairy godmother turned the mice into horse horses to draw a carriage."
39-1,"To make a carriage, she, um, used a pumpkin, and the, um, footman for the carriage was the dog."
39-1,"So , Cinderella goes off to the ball,."
39-1,"but the fairy godmother said, but you must be home by the stroke of midnight,."
39-1,because all of this will disappear.
39-1,"Well, when Cinderella shows up at the ball."
39-1,All heads turn her way.
39-1,"because she is not only the most beautifully dressed, but she is the most beautiful girl at the ball."
39-1,While the stepmother.
39-1,"Keeps looking at things, she looks familiar, she looks familiar,."
39-1,but she couldn't decide.
39-1,"Well, the prince walked past every one of all the other girls."
39-1,and danced only with Cinderella that night.
39-1,Cinderella was having a very good time.
39-1,"However, the clock started to strike midnight,."
39-1,and Cinder Cinderella realized.
39-1,"that she had to be home,."
39-1,"so she ran out very quickly,."
39-1,"and running down the steps, she lost one of her glass slippers."
39-1,and just about got home.
39-1,"Well, the poor prince was so upset."
39-1,that he did not know who this girl was.
39-1,"or could not find her, did not have a name, that the next day, the prince."
39-1,and his entourage went out to the countryside.
39-1,and took the one glass slipper.
39-1,and tried to fit it on every young maiden in the area.
39-1,"So , knowing."
39-1,"that this was coming to happen, the stepmother decided to lock Cinderella into the castle, into the house,."
39-1,so she could not meet the prince.
39-1,"Well, just."
39-1,as the prince was trying on the slipper.
39-1,"for the two stepsisters, one, both of whom had very large feet, and not the tiny foot."
39-1,"that would fit into this glass slipper, Cinderella and the mice were able to free her from the area where she was locked."
39-1,"And went downstairs, just?"
39-1,"as Cinderella came running out, when the prince said, Aren't there any other young maidens in your house?"
39-1,"And the stepmother said, No."
39-1,Cinderella came running out.
39-1,"and said, Yes, I'm here, I'm here."
39-1,"Well, just."
39-1,"as she was running, the stepmother tripped her."
39-1,And the slipper was the slipper.
39-1,that the prince was holding to walk to her was broken.
39-1,"Brokenhearted, the prince said, Well, I'll never know who the girl is."
39-1,"And Cinderella said, Well, that 's all right,."
39-1,because I have the other slipper here.
39-1,So he tried the slipper onto Cinderella.
39-1,"It fit beautifully,."
39-1,"and just then, of course, the fairy godmother came by, changed Cinderella into a beautiful princess again,."
39-1,and off she went with the prince to be married.
39-1,and live happily ever after.
39-1,"The stepmother and the stepsisters, however, were not so happy about this, neither was Cinderella."
39-1,"So Cinderella made them become servants into the prince's castle, that 's the end of the story."
39-1,Cinderella was happy with the prince.
39-1,"They lived happily ever after, and the stepmother."
39-1,and stepsister got what they deserved.
04-1,"Her name, uh, I'm not even sure her name was Cinderella,."
04-1,"but there was a young girl, maybe her name was even Ella,."
04-1,and later on she gets called Cinderella.
04-1,"Um, anyway, she ends up having a stepmother come on the scene who has two daughters, and she's very nice to her two daughters, but she's mean to Cinderella."
04-1,"Uh, the two daughters, uh, are, are pampered."
04-1,and treated very well.
04-1,"Cinderella has to do a lot of the housework and the grunt work and ,."
04-1,and clean the fireplace.
04-1,and do all kinds of things like.
04-1,"that Uh, then one day they are invited to a ball, a royal ball, and , um, the daughters."
04-1,"and the stepmother get all dressed up and all fancy,."
04-1,but Cinderella is told.
04-1,that she may not go.
04-1,"She has, she has to do chores at home instead."
04-1,"while the stepmother and the daughters, her daughters are gone, uh, Cinderella finds out."
04-1,"that she has a fairy godmother,."
04-1,"and the fairy godmother, uh, gets her all dressed."
04-1,"and has these little helpers, little, they look like little mice helpers,."
04-1,"and she, um, makes a beautiful dress for Cinderella,."
04-1,and Cinderella goes.
04-1,"and they, they take a pumpkin."
04-1,and the pumpkin becomes a beautiful um coach.
04-1,"And the um little critters become horses,."
04-1,"and they take her to the ball,."
04-1,"and she dances with the the the handsome prince,."
04-1,and then she knows she has to be back by midnight.
04-1,or the the coach will turn into a pumpkin again.
04-1,"So she quickly leaves the the ball at midnight,."
04-1,"but as she leaves, uh one of her glass slippers comes off."
04-1,"and the prince wants to find her, and his clue is the glass slipper."
04-1,So he goes.
04-1,Throughout the kingdom.
04-1,"and to find the girl who fits the glass slipper,."
04-1,"and he, the, the stepdaughters tried, they're hoping."
04-1,that they'll fit into the slipper.
04-1,"because they want to marry the handsome prince, but ,."
04-1,"and they, they try to pretend."
04-1,"that Cinderella really doesn't need to try it on,."
04-1,"but she does,."
04-1,"and it fits her, and she."
04-1,and the prince marry.
04-1,and live happily ever after.
