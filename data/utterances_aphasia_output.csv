858,williamson13a,Her mother was uh a little bit of a domineering lady.
859,williamson13a,"Uh, They apparently got word."
860,williamson13a,that there was gonna be a ball.

878,williamson13a,"And much to her surprise, Prince Charming came riding up to the house in his carriage."
879,williamson13a,"I was looking for who, The, the slipper."

3541,Baycrest10634a,"And then down the road a bit, there was a Sort of the two ugly old lady, two young ladies who were rather shall we say not the most attractive people, and then the old lady who was a grumble."
3542,Baycrest10634a,"And , um,."
3543,Baycrest10634a,"And so the whole point of this was they were supposed to Meat The Not Cinderella, but the, the, the two, the men and the woman."
3544,Baycrest10634a,To meet them.
3545,Baycrest10634a,"And the purpose was who would meet the, the pretty one."
3546,Baycrest10634a,So what they did was they got.
3547,Baycrest10634a,and they of course they had to get the dresses.
3548,Baycrest10634a,"and they had to look, you know, put all their stuff up."
3549,Baycrest10634a,"and so knowing Cinderella, the two ladies."
3550,Baycrest10634a,Bumblebee and Bimbobo or whatever where um Looking forward to this.
3551,Baycrest10634a,"because they were going to have the chance to meet this, Handsome man."
3552,Baycrest10634a,"And they were, and of course the lady who was behind it was the The their mother, who was not the most attractive person anyway."
3553,Baycrest10634a,So they got ready and they.

3560,Baycrest10634a,"A big, um, pumpkin."
3561,Baycrest10634a,"And they said, This isn't right."
3562,Baycrest10634a,Why are we not going to do something for her?
3563,Baycrest10634a,"So they gave, they decided."
3564,Baycrest10634a,"that They, what they did was they met the uh Pumpkin."
3565,Baycrest10634a,And they had a magic wand.
3566,Baycrest10634a,"And they did a little, oh, yes,."
3567,Baycrest10634a,"and also they were thinking we've got to make her, make her better than she was before."
3568,Baycrest10634a,"So, I'm, I'm a little lost in this one,."
3569,Baycrest10634a,but I think they did the magic wand.
3570,Baycrest10634a,"and she changed from a raggedy person into a rather attractive looking, um, um, person, and her name would be Cinderella, I think it says."
3571,Baycrest10634a,"So, That 's what happened."
3572,Baycrest10634a,"It's not over yet though, so they said, how are we going to get home?"

3583,Baycrest10634a,"And finally, Cinderella met this person who was late."
3584,Baycrest10634a,But he finally made it there.
3585,Baycrest10634a,"And , uh,."
3586,Baycrest10634a,"and they said, why don't you try it."
3587,Baycrest10634a,and see.
3588,Baycrest10634a,if it works for you.
3589,Baycrest10634a,And guess what?
3590,Baycrest10634a,"He did a little magic wand,."
3591,Baycrest10634a,and she put her shoe on.

3593,Baycrest10634a,"The story is, have the right feet."
3594,Baycrest9772a,"So Cinderella had some stepsisters and a stepmother, and uh they were cruel to her."
3595,Baycrest9772a,"and um she managed to uh make, make out with the prince, and she was at the dance."
3596,Baycrest9772a,"And um she lost her shoe,."

3600,adler04a,Poor Cinderella.
3601,adler04a,"Uh, She's always working, working, working."
3602,adler04a,And The other family members were cavorting.

3604,adler04a,And she gives her everything.
3605,adler04a,Took on the ball.
3606,adler04a,Including a horse and carriage.

3614,adler04a,and Cinderella has to go home.
3615,adler04a,because there is no more.
3616,adler04a,A gown.
3617,adler04a,and So Cinderella goes home.

3619,adler04a,"And sure enough, Cinderella."
3620,adler04a,"Uh, fits the shoe."
3621,adler04a,And her sisters didn't.

3623,elman01a,There's a.
3624,elman01a,"The father, that one I don't, I don't understand,."
3625,elman01a,but There's a uh.
3626,elman01a,"A woman Older one,."
3627,elman01a,and she has 2.
3628,elman01a,Two daughters.
3629,elman01a,Probably.
3630,elman01a,"And The Cinderella, she's, she has to."
3631,elman01a,"Lived there, I think, I think."

3641,elman01a,The Chess to do it.
3642,elman01a,"And they said no, like."
3643,elman01a,"So , uh, you know, she's sad,."
3644,elman01a,so Then It's probably she was uh.
3645,elman01a,Just sad or I just or a dream or something.
3646,elman01a,Then there's a uh.
3647,elman01a,It's really hard.
3648,elman01a,It's gonna be.
3649,elman01a,either It's either his dreaming.
3650,elman01a,"No, no, it's, it's, it's true."
3651,elman01a,It's not true.

3657,elman01a,"Pumpkin, there's a carrot, uh."
3658,elman01a,Carriage carriage or something.
3659,elman01a,And then they go to a uh a ball and that's why the and that's why the the prince they went to a date or something.
3660,elman01a,so they went to a ball.
3661,elman01a,and I think she had uh the time.
3662,elman01a,so she has to go back home.

3668,elman01a,The horses are gone.
3669,elman01a,"She's back home,."
3670,elman01a,and then I think.
3671,elman01a,The end I forgot.
3672,elman01a,"Either The uh the prince, she take, take, take him out or somewhere out."
3673,elman01a,and now they're uh.

3850,adler03a,And he was madly in love with her.
3851,adler03a,that 's the end of the story.
3852,UNH01a,"All right, so I just, just come up with that on my own."
3853,UNH01a,"Um, all right, Cinderella was clearly a poor girl."
3854,UNH01a,She was a servant.
3855,UNH01a,"That was the word I forgot, she was a servant."
3856,UNH01a,They showed her doing servant stuff.
3857,UNH01a,"They also showed, I assume one woman was a queen."
3858,UNH01a,and she had.
3859,UNH01a,"Two daughters,."
3860,UNH01a,and it looks.
3861,UNH01a,"like there was going to be some, again, I can't come up with it."
3862,UNH01a,I want to say some dance.
3863,UNH01a,"There's, there's a better word to call it,."
3864,UNH01a,but it looks.
3865,UNH01a,like there's a prince that was being honored in this.
3866,UNH01a,"Dance, um."
3867,UNH01a,The the somewhat grumpy daughters were invited to go and The thing I don't remember is.
3868,UNH01a,if Cinderella was invited.
3869,UNH01a,"or somebody just, she wanted, she definitely wanted to go,."
3870,UNH01a,and I can't remember.
3871,UNH01a,"if the, again, there was another person who I think was a magic person who again, I don't remember exactly what they're called, she's called,."
3872,UNH01a,whether Cinderella wanted to go.
3873,UNH01a,"and someone said, I'll help you,."
3874,UNH01a,"or she was invited, I don't remember,."
3875,UNH01a,"but she, this, this person, this magic person that I can't think of what they call them, um, helped her get ready, helped her get dressed."
3876,UNH01a,It looks.
3877,UNH01a,like they may have made the horses and the carriage.
3878,UNH01a,"and the people, they may have set that up."
3879,UNH01a,for her to get her there.
3880,UNH01a,She had.
3881,UNH01a,"Now, this I remember,."
3882,UNH01a,but I don't know.
3883,UNH01a,if it was specifically shown here.
3884,UNH01a,I know Cinderella only had a certain amount of time.
3885,UNH01a,"I guess the magic person did something for her, for a short period of time,."
3886,UNH01a,and then she went back to her normal self.
3887,UNH01a,"So she went to this dance, had a great time, met the Prince, which that was, I kept forgetting Prince, met the Prince."
3888,UNH01a,Prince liked her.
3889,UNH01a,The ugly sisters were there.
3890,UNH01a,I don't think anybody really liked them.
3891,UNH01a,They thought they were going to meet the prince.
3892,UNH01a,or marry the prince or something like that.
3893,UNH01a,"Um, Cinderella, when it came down to the time she had to go, she ran out of there quickly."
3894,UNH01a,"because immediately she just switched back to her, her old clothes and what she looked like before."
3895,UNH01a,Um.
3896,UNH01a,"And apparently, the prince missed her,."
3897,UNH01a,and he went looking for her.
3898,UNH01a,"and found Cinderella looking as the, the The first Cinderella she was, which again, that's not the way I want, the poor Cinderella, I guess."
3899,UNH01a,"Um, found Cinderella, knew it was her."
3900,UNH01a,"because he put on the shoe that fit her that was tried on at the The dance, which I can't remember what that."
3901,UNH01a,"It's called a dance,."
3902,UNH01a,"but anyways, she had tried on the shoe when she was there."
3903,UNH01a,"The prince tried on the shoe when he found her out, probably in the country or in her house."
3904,UNH01a,"or whatever, realized it was the woman he was after,."
3905,UNH01a,"and apparently asked her to marry him,."
3906,UNH01a,and they lived happily ever after.
3907,whiteside02a,"Father, um."
3908,whiteside02a,"Uh, her mother died."
3909,whiteside02a,"and her father used another walt, and she wasn't nice,."
3910,whiteside02a,"and she had another, she had 22 daughters, and they were nasty and ugly."
3911,whiteside02a,"Anyway, the father apparently didn't know what was going on."
3912,whiteside02a,"because she allows the, the, the, uh, the, the, the, her mother just take, take badly."
3913,whiteside02a,She couldn't do everything she was wrong.
3914,whiteside02a,"They wouldn't allow to allow her to do anything, and , um, the, uh, so she was very, very upset,?"
3915,whiteside02a,"and now there is a, Now who did this?"
3916,whiteside02a,"Um, The, uh, the, the, the, the, the cass, the kins, kins, the kiss, um, was giving a bow from his, for his son,."
3917,whiteside02a,"and he wanted his son to find a beautiful woman for, for, for, to, to live, to live with her, to, um, so."
3918,whiteside02a,"And so everybody was supposed to go to the bar,."
3919,whiteside02a,but they wouldn't allow Simmons to go.
3920,whiteside02a,"because the, the Aboriginavs, they didn't want her there."
3921,whiteside02a,They would not allow her to go.
3922,whiteside02a,"Anyway,."
3923,whiteside02a,"after they'd all gone to the banks, this, this sweet, sweet old lady, I wish, I wish, I That's not the word I, glambe, what do they call her, but she was a good, good loss, good lass,."
3924,whiteside02a,"and she tells the sim is, you know, you can go."
3925,whiteside02a,and I'm gonna help you.
3926,whiteside02a,"And she, she gives him, gives him, she uses a, whatever she's got a lung,."
3927,whiteside02a,"and makes her a beautiful, a beautiful dress and with a beautiful, uh, place to go, you know, with a house and everything."
3928,whiteside02a,And of course she gets the bow.
3929,whiteside02a,and everybody thinks she is the most beautiful person they've ever seen.
3930,whiteside02a,"And of course the, the king, the, the, the the clans, the king's son saw him."
3931,whiteside02a,"and he just finds, loved her,."
3932,whiteside02a,"and she, he knows this is the womb he wants to wound."
3933,whiteside02a,"But the, the, the, um, the, the, the, the, she's not a walt, but what is a war on?"
3934,whiteside02a,"I had one of, I had two of those,."
3935,whiteside02a,and I love them.
3936,whiteside02a,"What were, what we called them,."
3937,whiteside02a,and I love this.
3938,whiteside02a,"Anyway, they, um, they told her, she told me, you have to come back by 12."
3939,whiteside02a,"And uh she was running so fast, he he dropped her little glass sermon."
3940,whiteside02a,"because she knew she would go back to who she was by then,."
3941,whiteside02a,and she rushed off.
3942,whiteside02a,"Anyway, the, the king's son was so upset, he tells them, we have to find this man, she has to be someone, you've gotta find her."
3943,whiteside02a,So they go everywhere to see who could watch the scene.
3944,whiteside02a,She must have very tiny swans.
3945,whiteside02a,"Anyway, they went everywhere."
3946,whiteside02a,and finally they come to pass.
3947,whiteside02a,"and the old woman said, oh, mine certainly couldn't, couldn't get them out."
3948,whiteside02a,and cut them off or something.
3949,whiteside02a,"She told one cold is a spot on, one cos what's on."
3950,whiteside02a,Yeah.
3951,whiteside02a,"And , uh,?"
3952,whiteside02a,but then they looked?
3953,whiteside02a,"and said, isn't there a child here?"
3954,whiteside02a,"No, no,."
3955,whiteside02a,"and then she said, well, she's just the old, she just, you know, she doesn't matter."
3956,whiteside02a,"So she said, she, well you still, you, I have to do."
3957,whiteside02a,"and get her trying, of course, as soon."
3958,whiteside02a,"as she puts it down, it was like, she's a beautiful woman and who she is,."
3959,whiteside02a,and then she comes back.
3960,whiteside05a,"OK, well, It was, uh Widow, the, uh, the man was like a, with a little kid, Cinderella,."
3961,whiteside05a,"and she got engaged, uh, with me."
