4141,14-1,and decked her out for the ball.
4142,14-1,"And she gave her some glass slippers,."
4143,14-1,but she cautioned her.
4144,14-1,that she had to be home by midnight.
4145,14-1,Cinderella was having such a good time when she got to the ball.
4146,14-1,that she didn't take notice of the time.
4147,14-1,"And all of a sudden, it was midnight."
4148,14-1,She ran down the stairs to get back to the um Coach.
4149,14-1,"and on the way down the stairs, she lost her slipper."
4150,14-1,"So when she got home, everything was back."
4151,14-1,"like it was,."
4152,14-1,"and the prince who had fallen in love with Cinderella wanted to find her, so he had a a search party going throughout the kingdom saying whoever could slip in this picture, I mean in this slipper, uh was the one he would marry."
4153,14-1,and He finally found.
4154,14-1,"after the stepsisters tried to Put on the slipper, they couldn't of course,."
4155,14-1,but it fits Cinderella.
4156,14-1,End of story.
4157,14-1,She lived happily ever after as a princess.
4158,Baycrest11634,"OK, so Cinderella was um."
4159,Baycrest11634,"She was, she was, um, living with her stepmother."
4160,Baycrest11634,And 22 stepsisters.
4161,Baycrest11634,"Who were not very kind to her, not, not any of them were very kind to her."
4162,Baycrest11634,And uh there was a big ball.
4163,Baycrest11634,that was supposed to be happening.
4164,Baycrest11634,and um so um everybody was getting ready to go to the ball.
4165,Baycrest11634,And um oh well she was being used as a as a um.
4166,Baycrest11634,Really as a servant.
4167,Baycrest11634,Picking up after her stepsisters and her stepmother.
4168,Baycrest11634,And um.
4169,Baycrest11634,So there was a ball that um.
4170,Baycrest11634,Was being being arranged and um.
4171,Baycrest11634,"All the stepsisters were getting ready to uh go to the ball,."
4172,Baycrest11634,and they weren't inviting her at all.
4173,Baycrest11634,and she wasn't going to get to go.
4174,Baycrest11634,And um.
4175,Baycrest11634,"Interestingly enough, I can't remember how the heck she got hold of a nice dress."
4176,Baycrest11634,"But um She was Touched by a magic wand and her, her beautiful, um."
4177,Baycrest11634,"Her poor dress turned into a beautiful looking dress,."
4178,Baycrest11634,and she had lovely shoes on and everything was really gorgeous and um.
4179,Baycrest11634,The prince saw her.
4180,Baycrest11634,and ignored the two other sisters.
4181,Baycrest11634,Or rather stepsisters.
4182,Baycrest11634,and just wanted to um.
4183,Baycrest11634,Be with her.
4184,Baycrest11634,But then Just before midnight she was supposed to have to run away.
4185,Baycrest11634,because the um magic godmother said you have to disappear at midnight.
4186,Baycrest11634,because everything will turn back into normal and your beautiful dress and your beautiful clothes will be back to the poor little um.
4187,Baycrest11634,"Um, stuff."
4188,Baycrest11634,"that you, you were wearing originally."
4189,Baycrest11634,So just before midnight.
4190,Baycrest11634,She started running away.
4191,Baycrest11634,"And um, The prince Was trying to catch her."
4192,Baycrest11634,and was looking.
4193,Baycrest11634,To see her.

4195,Baycrest11634,"as she was running away, she lost one shoe."
4196,Baycrest11634,And the shoe stuck on the steps.
4197,Baycrest11634,and she kept running.
4198,Baycrest11634,because she knew.
4199,Baycrest11634,that she had to disappear.
4200,Baycrest11634,And so she went back to her little.
4201,Baycrest11634,Huddle cabin where she was.
4202,Baycrest11634,Being kept And Her clothes.
4203,Baycrest11634,and everything turned back to her normal mended self.
4204,Baycrest11634,Yeah And um With the exception of the one shoe.
4205,Baycrest11634,that got left behind.
4206,Baycrest11634,And so the prince decided.
4207,Baycrest11634,that he was going to find.

4220,Baycrest11634,"and Being very, um, you know, domesticated."
4221,Baycrest11634,And um He went.
4222,Baycrest11634,and tried the shoes on on everybody.
4223,Baycrest11634,"as the story would go the shoes were too small for everybody, too small for each of the stepsisters,."
4224,Baycrest11634,as we in our heads know that small feet are wonderful.
4225,Baycrest11634,"OK, anyway, so the shoe just would not fit on anybody and finally, um."
4226,Baycrest11634,"He said,."

4441,61-1,and live happily ever after.
4442,28-1,"Yeah, so, uh, Cinderella has been uh uh adopted by the a stepmother."

4444,28-1,"In fact, Cinderella is really, um, her name is Ella,."
4445,28-1,and it's because the Cinders.
4446,28-1,because they make her clean the chimney.
4447,28-1,and do all the work around the house so often and they're cruel to her.
4448,28-1,"So, uh, eventually, uh, She cries to her fairy godmother, the fairy godmother basically says, Hey, we can fix this."
4449,28-1,"We can have you go to the ball,."
4450,28-1,"and I'll take your rags, turn it into riches, um, they make the pumpkin into the carriage, the, the mice become the, the footman."

4454,28-1,Stepsists.
4455,28-1,"and the mother, then, um, well, the prince basically says, hey."
4456,28-1,If I find who this glass slipper.

4794,74-1,They treated her if she was the maid.
4795,74-1,and she cleaned.
4796,74-1,"and took care of things, and they were not very nice to her in any way, shape or form."

4803,74-1,She's sad.

4956,MJE8703a,"Oh, yeah, she's putting a shoe on."
4957,11-1,"All right, so Cinderella was one of 3 girls in a family."
4958,11-1,And she had a stepmom who was wicked.
4959,11-1,And The prince of the community had invited.
4960,11-1,"The children To attend a party, um, a ball,."
4961,11-1,"and everyone got dressed for the ball, except Cinderella because she was a stepchild."
4962,11-1,"Her two sisters were stepsisters,."
4963,11-1,"and they didn't really care for her a lot, or they were jealous, uh, exceedingly jealous people who Didn't like Cinderella at all."
4964,11-1,So They wanted to shield her from being able to participate in an event when the prince invited the sisters to the ball.
4965,11-1,"And the sisters dressed all up in their best clothes to go,."
4966,11-1,and Cinderella was left.
4967,11-1,To sit at the heart side.
4968,11-1,and not participate.
4969,11-1,"And then Um, For an unexplained reason."
4970,11-1,Cinderella was invited to participate also.
4971,11-1,I guess by the prince.
4972,11-1,Because he was a good guy.
4973,11-1,"So the,."
4974,11-1,"so She didn't have a costume, and she was a a a ball gown,."
4975,11-1,and she was asked to She was asked to come to the affair.
4976,11-1,Both her stepmother.
4977,11-1,"and her stepsisters really didn't like that ,."
4978,11-1,"but they let her go, they let her participate also."
4979,11-1,So she dressed.
4980,11-1,"But she didn't have the appropriate clothes,."
4981,11-1,and she was probably embarrassed by.
4982,11-1,that They were delighted.
4983,11-1,that she wasn't gonna go.
4984,11-1,"if she goes,."
4985,11-1,"if she went, she was gonna look bad."
4986,11-1,"So they got all dressed up and were ready to go, and Cinderella."
4987,11-1,Found her fairy godmother.
4988,11-1,"I don't remember how,."
4989,11-1,"but anyway, she found her fairy godmother."
4990,11-1,"and her fairy godmother said, I'll give you some wishes for things you might want."
4991,11-1,"Well, she wanted a gown."
4992,11-1,And she wanted to be all dressed up and fancy.
4993,11-1,and look really good.
4994,11-1,And she went to the went to the ball with them.
4995,11-1,There was the condition.
4996,11-1,The condition was she had to be back by midnight.
4997,11-1,"So she went to the ball, she danced."
4998,11-1,and had a wonderful time.
4999,11-1,She captured the prince's heart.
5000,11-1,"And the prince Um, invited her to dance with him for the evening."
5001,11-1,She was the belle of the ball.
5002,11-1,She was the clock stroke struck midnight.
5003,11-1,"And she ran, she realized."
5004,11-1,that she'd overextended her stay.
5005,11-1,"The conditions of her stay,."
5006,11-1,"and she ran out,."
5007,11-1,"and when she did, she ran right out of one of her slippers."
5008,11-1,And left it there.
5009,11-1,At the ball.
5010,11-1,"She got into the coach, went back to the to her home, and was back in time."
5011,11-1,that nothing serious happened.
5012,11-1,"The prince, though, wanted to know who was this lady?"
5013,11-1,"and where did she come and who, what was her name?"
5014,11-1,"So , He sent out a notice to all the people in his Kingdom To for any girls."
5015,11-1,To come.
5016,11-1,and try on this slipper to see.
5017,11-1,"if it would fit her,."
5018,11-1,"and he decided that he could, he would be able to recognize who it was."
5019,11-1,and confirm.
5020,11-1,"What the who the person was,."
5021,11-1,"if she wore the right size shoe, the right size slipper."
5022,11-1,"that he had, and it was very unusual."
5023,11-1,"It was a glass slipper,."
5024,11-1,that people couldn't just fake it or anything like.
5025,11-1,So it's to be a an honest assessment.
5026,11-1,"She um Her sisters, the prince sent his people out."
5027,11-1,"Um, with a slipper to look at all the young girls in the kingdom to find out."
5028,11-1,"if one of them had had the proper size, the hole to fit that shoe."
5029,11-1,"And they got to um Cinderella's stepmother's home,."
5030,11-1,and Cinderella was not asked to participate.
5031,11-1,"Um, the other two sisters participated, either the two, the shoe was much too small or much too large for their feet clearly was not their size, and the princes."
5032,11-1,"Um, couriers were were unable to find a person who fit the shoe."
5033,11-1,So they tried one more time.
5034,11-1,"and Cinderella was finally asked to be one of their participants,."
5035,11-1,and of course the shoe fit her perfectly.
5036,11-1,And uh she and the prince.
5037,11-1,She and the prince.
5038,11-1,"Oh, we're, I can't remember what happened then."
5039,11-1,She and the prince.
5040,11-1,"Anyway, she married, she ended up."
5041,11-1,"I guess the story ends, she, I don't remember,."
5042,11-1,but I guess she ends up the story by she got married to.
5043,11-1,or she got to dance with the prince.
5044,11-1,"and the prince loved her,."
5045,11-1,"and he, she loved him,."
5046,11-1,and they lived happily ever after.
5047,11-1,And somehow mice were involved in it and other things.
5048,11-1,that I vaguely remember.
5049,Baycrest12829,She went to uh the ball in a pumpkin.
5050,Baycrest12829,And uh Pumpkin Drawn by 6 white horses.
5051,Baycrest12829,And uh she lost her slipper.
5052,Baycrest12829,And the prints.
5053,Baycrest12829,Charming Try it on and The two.
5054,Baycrest12829,Sistyuglers.
5055,Baycrest12829,Uh didn't.
5056,Baycrest12829,But uh it fit Cinderella.
5057,Baycrest12829,And so they lived happily ever.
5058,Baycrest8538,Cinderella lived with her two.
5059,Baycrest8538,"Stepsisters and stepmother, well, actually."
5060,Baycrest8538,"She had a father, um."
5061,Baycrest8538,"Uh, who she adored, he adored her."
5062,Baycrest8538,and then he passed away and then.
5063,Baycrest8538,"Uh, she."
5064,Baycrest8538,Fell under the care of this uh wicked stepmother.
5065,Baycrest8538,And uh She was uh.
5066,Baycrest8538,"Uh, stepmother definitely favored her two other daughters."
5067,Baycrest8538,"Um, Cinderella was put to all the menial."
5068,Baycrest8538,Chores.
5069,Baycrest8538,"And then uh in the kingdom, uh, there it was announced."
5070,Baycrest8538,"that the young prince was looking for a bride,."
5071,Baycrest8538,and they were gonna throw this big ball.
5072,Baycrest8538,And uh.
5073,Baycrest8538,"At the 11th hour, uh, Cinderella was told no, she couldn't go to this ball, um,."
5074,Baycrest8538,and she was locked up in the.
5075,Baycrest8538,"was locked up, uh, confined by her by her, uh, stepmother."
5076,Baycrest8538,"Um, and all these little, uh, creatures here, the mice."
5077,Baycrest8538,"and , oh, first, uh, the, uh, fairy godmother came along and , uh."
5078,Baycrest8538,"Uh, clothe her in this beautiful gown."
5079,Baycrest8538,and Assisted by these little creatures.
5080,Baycrest8538,and then the uh pumpkin was turned into a coach.
5081,Baycrest8538,"I forget what was turned into horses,."
5082,Baycrest8538,"but anyway, uh, she went to the ball, um, she, the, the."
5083,Baycrest8538,"She, she caught the eye of the immediately of the eye of the prince."
5084,Baycrest8538,He didn't.
5085,Baycrest8538,"See any other girl for the rest of the night, they danced, they had a great time,."
5086,Baycrest8538,but she was told by the fairy godmother.
5087,Baycrest8538,that she had to be home.
5088,Baycrest8538,By midnight because the uh.
5089,Baycrest8538,"Um, what's, what's the word, the, uh, spell, uh, would end at midnight."
5090,Baycrest8538,"that she had cast, you know, the, um."
5091,Baycrest8538,"So when Cinderella, she lost track of time,."

5095,Baycrest8538,"as she was driving away, the coach changed."
5096,Baycrest8538,And everything she would return to the the rags on her back.
5097,Baycrest8538,and the horses turned to mice or whatever.

5394,43-1,"so doing, she drops her glass slipper."
5395,43-1,"And um she gets home, you know, just in time."

5397,43-1,"that the prince met the love of his life,."
5398,43-1,"but she had to leave, and the only thing she left behind was the glass slipper."

5400,43-1,by going around.
5401,43-1,"and trying on the glass slipper,."
5402,43-1,because Cinderella has these beautiful little petite feet.

5404,43-1,"or whatever, go around, they start conducting their search, trying on."
5405,43-1,"Shoes on woman after woman, including the wicked stepsisters who had big ugly feet,."

5416,43-1,"and oh voila, magically it fits."

5497,AMR6628a,Um-hum.
5498,AMR6628a,OK.
5499,AMR6628a,"And so, Um, So now this man has the thing."
5500,AMR6628a,"because The, the."
5501,AMR6628a,And it's dinged 12.
5502,AMR6628a,and she had to run home.
5503,AMR6628a,"And then she, he, this is the man."
5504,AMR6628a,that 's um carrying the her uh um yeah.
5505,AMR6628a,Um.
5506,AMR6628a,And then.

5508,AMR6628a,"I know how that is, um."
5509,AMR6628a,"And this one is, no."
5510,AMR6628a,And then he down comes Cinderella.
5511,AMR6628a,"And so I said, oh, look, it's."
5512,AMR6628a,And so.
5513,AMR6628a,She had She put on the and all her fancy um.
5514,AMR6628a,And you use.
5515,57-1,OK.
5516,57-1,"Um, this is a little bit more difficult, quite honestly."
5517,57-1,"Um, OK, so Cinderella, um, lost her mom."
5518,57-1,and her dad remarries.
5519,57-1,"Unfortunately, the woman."
5520,57-1,"that he remarries, um, is a very mean stepmother to Cinderella."
5521,57-1,Cinderella has two stepsisters.
5522,57-1,"Um, the stepmother loves her children."
5523,57-1,but has no room in her heart for Cinderella.
5524,57-1,And so Cinderella um is the one who gets to do all of the chores and all of the work.
5525,57-1,"There is going to be a celebration in, in the town,."
5526,57-1,"and um the prince has called a big party, and the stepmother is all set to send her daughters, um, who are unkind and um Somewhat homely actually, um,."
5527,57-1,and she is preparing them to go to the ball and in hopes.
5528,57-1,that perhaps the prince will notice them and maybe one of them would be lucky enough to be chosen as his wife.
5529,57-1,"Of course, Cinderella is told."
5530,57-1,"that she cannot go to the ball, and ,."
5531,57-1,and so what happens is.
5532,57-1,that her fairy godmother appears to her.
5533,57-1,and says.
5534,57-1,"that yes, she will go to the ball."
5535,57-1,"and she outfits her with a Beautiful, beautiful dress,."
5536,57-1,and there are little mice.
5537,57-1,that come.
5538,57-1,"and help Cinderella because Cinderella was very, very kind to the animals and they in turn were kind to her,."
5539,57-1,and they help her to get dressed.
5540,57-1,and the fairy godmother even provides a beautiful.
5541,57-1,In carriage.
5542,57-1,for Cinderella to ride to in the ball.
5543,57-1,"Uh, one of the things."
5544,57-1,that Cinderella had in addition to her beautiful dress was a beautiful pair of high heel shoes.
5545,57-1,"And at the ball, she begins to have a good time."
5546,57-1,"and is dancing,."
5547,57-1,"as I recall, with the prince when all of a sudden she recalls that before when the clock strikes 12."
5548,57-1,"She must return,."
5549,57-1,"or else she will return to the person that she, not the person."
5550,57-1,"that she was, but the dress."
5551,57-1,"that she was, everything."
5552,57-1,"that was, she was at the ball is now gonna fall away."
5553,57-1,and she's going to be plain old Cinderella.
5554,57-1,So.
5555,57-1,"as she hears the clock chiming 12, she is running out of the palace."
5556,57-1,and she loses one of her shoes.
5557,57-1,I believe it's a la a glass slipper.
5558,57-1,She goes home and lo.
5559,57-1,"and behold, the prince um is running after her, can't find her,."
5560,57-1,but he finds the shoe.
5561,57-1,that she left behind.
5562,57-1,"And so he sets out throughout the kingdom to find the person, the beautiful young woman who lost her shoe."
5563,57-1,"And so he goes with his entourage from house to house, putting this slipper onto the foot of all of the young women."
5564,57-1,that attended it.
5565,57-1,"Oh,."
5566,57-1,"and he gets to Cinderella's home,."
5567,57-1,and he comes in.
5568,57-1,"and of course, the two stepsisters are hoping that this beautiful glass."
5569,57-1,It does not.
5570,57-1,"And by chance, Cinderella is asked for her foot,."
5571,57-1,and the glass slipper fits the foot of Cinderella.
5572,57-1,Cinderella.
5573,57-1,and the prince are married.
5574,57-1,and we live happily ever after.
5575,19-1,"Cinderella was, um, her father had passed away, she was living in the house."
5576,19-1,With her wicked stepmother and to.
5577,19-1,"Not so nice stepsisters, um."
5578,19-1,She was doing all the work.
5579,19-1,They were taking advantage of her.
5580,19-1,A um Uh.
5581,19-1,"The family, the, the mother, the stepmother."
5582,19-1,and stepsisters were going to uh a ball.
5583,19-1,"Uh, Cinderella was gonna be left at home."
5584,19-1,"But um, I think her fairy godmother helped her get to the ball."
5585,19-1,"She met with the prince, uh, they fell in love."
5586,19-1,"Um, The uh."
5587,19-1,And she Left the ball.
5588,19-1,and um lost her slipper.
5589,19-1,One of her shoes and uh.
5590,19-1,The prince was able to find her.
5591,19-1,and um Identify her by by the uh shoes that she had lost.
5592,19-1,And um They got married in the happily ever after.
5593,01-1,"OK, well, there was this family and once upon a time, of course, it was this family,."
5594,01-1,"and then in the family, there was a, so it was a case of a second marriage."
5595,01-1,and mama brought her to.
5596,01-1,"Uh, pain and their daughters to the household,."
5597,01-1,and then there was Cinderella.
5598,01-1,"Ella lived in the household,."
5599,01-1,"and then they came in and , and were very cruel to her."
5600,01-1,and made her do all the menial tasks and everything like.
5601,01-1,"And then finally someone comes along and Is, are you there?"
5602,01-1,OK.
5603,01-1,Someone comes along from the from the king's palace.
5604,01-1,and says there's going to be a ball.
5605,01-1,that all the young ladies of a certain age are to go.
5606,01-1,"And so they're getting already, the two girls, the the daughters in the household are getting all ready to go."
5607,01-1,and they get all their fancy clothes and everything.
5608,01-1,"And of course Cinderella isn't even being bothered with,."
5609,01-1,but a fairy godmother comes along.
5610,01-1,"and she gets everything for her and her clothes and everything, and beautiful little glass slippers,."
5611,01-1,and then she goes to the ball.
5612,01-1,And she goes in a coach that 's really like a huge pumpkin.
5613,01-1,and the the stipulation is she has to be back home.
5614,01-1,I believe it's by midnight.
5615,01-1,before the clock chimes midnight.
5616,01-1,"Anyway, so she's having a wonderful time."
5617,01-1,and the prince thinks she's really cool.
5618,01-1,"and she Oh, We lost connection."
5619,01-1,"Hang on, we lost connection."
5620,01-1,"And um, when they get to the house where Cinderella is, she's not even to be bothered with,."
5621,01-1,"but they just they realize there's another person there, so they bring her in."
5622,01-1,and they place the slipper on her foot.
5623,01-1,"It fits perfectly, and the prince is very happy and she's very happy and they're together."
5624,01-1,and they live happily ever after.
5625,Baycrest12814,How do you get in get into words?

5663,20-1,"and telling me about the mice and everybody about what happened,."
5664,20-1,and The sisters don't understand it.
5665,20-1,"because she lost her shoe,."

5667,20-1,"and they went around to test everybody's feet,."
5668,20-1,"whether they would fit the shoe,."
5669,20-1,and only Cinderella got her foot into that glass slipper.
5670,20-1,And so they lived happily ever after.
5671,Baycrest12257,Cinderella.
5672,Baycrest12257,had I think 3 sisters.
5673,Baycrest12257,And uh they weren't very nice to her.
5674,Baycrest12257,And uh what happened?

5676,Baycrest12257,"And they called her names and stuff like that, but anyways um."
5677,Baycrest12257,I forget where how she met.

5696,277-1,"that she was,."
5697,277-1,"because she didn't have the good clothes like the stepsisters because the stepmother was really mean, so, um, when she got back to the house, she had lost her slipper, so they went, the people around town went looking for the person who had lost his."
5698,277-1,"Slipper,."

5714,18-1,"and it turned out to be, uh, Cinderella,."
5715,18-1,"and , uh, she, uh, ultimately went off with the Prince Charming,."
5716,18-1,and they lived their life.

6046,Baycrest11976,"and to see who fitted the slipper,."
6047,Baycrest11976,"and the prince found, found her that she was the one,."
6048,Baycrest11976,"and he asked her to marry her,."
6049,Baycrest11976,and she became the princess.
6050,Baycrest11976,"If I remember the story, something."
6051,PMR5861a,"This is her, she, she."
6052,PMR5861a,Um-hum.
6053,PMR5861a,"They just took her sisters, or , uh, uh, uh, uh, her mother."
6054,PMR5861a,OK.
6055,PMR5861a,"They, they were playing."
6056,PMR5861a,Good.
6057,PMR5861a,"Since ,."
6058,PMR5861a,"since the weather is coming,."
6059,PMR5861a,"And then, uh, Some don't let me go."

6062,PMR5861a,"And then she, The sisters and , and the mother."
6063,PMR5861a,"And then, then Cinderella,."
6064,PMR5861a,"and then she has her, her godmother, I mean, godmother."
6065,PMR5861a,And they had to get the uh carriage.
6066,PMR5861a,"And it, it was, uh, in front of,."
6067,PMR5861a,"And she had, uh,."
6068,PMR5861a,"and the, the device will came to uh the course."
6069,PMR5861a,"And the, the godmother made her a, a row."
6070,PMR5861a,"And told her to go to the, the, uh, Dance."
6071,PMR5861a,Um-hum.
6072,PMR5861a,"So parents saw her and then the, uh, uh, uh, it's 12 o'clock, she had, she, well, she had to go home."
6073,PMR5861a,"and she had, Uh, Or just for Christmas."
6074,PMR5861a,"And then, then, They went around 2, and they."
6075,PMR5861a,"She, they had to print the, The sisters."
6076,PMR5861a,"Yeah,."
6077,PMR5861a,"and then she her hair come out and ,."
6078,PMR5861a,"and she, her arms are hurt."
6079,PMR5861a,and it fit.
6080,PMR5861a,and she got married.
6081,216-1,A girl that came to live with her wicked stepmother and Two stepsisters.
6082,216-1,"They always made her do work around the house, cleaning and scrubbing."
6083,216-1,Uh One day there was an announcement of a ball.
6084,216-1,"And the two stepsisters were so excited, getting ready, ordering Cinderella around, having them, having her fix, fix their hair."
6085,216-1,"and make their dresses, and Cinderella was so sad."
6086,216-1,because her wicked stepmother said she wasn't going to the ball.
6087,216-1,"There's no way she has, she had no dress and she wasn't pretty enough."
6088,216-1,So the two stepsisters went to the ball.
6089,216-1,and A fairy godmother showed up.
6090,216-1,and put a spell on Cinderella.
6091,216-1,And the mice and the birds.
6092,216-1,and everybody whipped her dress.
6093,216-1,and the fairy godmother made a coach out of a pumpkin.
6094,216-1,and turned the mice into coachman.
6095,216-1,and told Cinderella she can go to the ball.
6096,216-1,"and have a good time,."
6097,216-1,"but at the stroke of midnight, she had to leave."
6098,216-1,"At the stroke of she heard the at the ball, she had a wonderful time dancing with the prince."
6099,216-1,and having a good time.
6100,216-1,At the then she heard the chimes of the clock striking midnight.
6101,216-1,She ran out of the ball.
6102,216-1,And lost one of her glass slippers on the staircase.
6103,216-1,The prince followed her.
6104,216-1,and picked up the slipper.
6105,216-1,Cinderella took off out of the ball.
6106,216-1,and Went home.
6107,216-1,"The prince wanted to find her, so he was going from house to house, having all the fair maids try on the slipper."
6108,216-1,"The two stepsisters tried to squeeze their big fat feet in them,."
6109,216-1,but they didn't fit.
6110,216-1,"Finally, they asked."
6111,216-1,"if there was any other girl living in the house,."
6112,216-1,and there they said.
6113,216-1,"Oh, there's Cinderella,."
6114,216-1,"but she didn't go to the ball,."
6115,216-1,but she came out.
6116,216-1,and tried to slipper on.
6117,216-1,and it fit like a glove.
6118,216-1,"and the prince knew it was her,."
6119,216-1,"and he picked her up, took her away,."
6120,216-1,and they lived happily ever after.
6121,63-1,I don't remember much about Cinderella.
6122,63-1,She worked in a house.
6123,63-1,"They were, um, I think like she was a maid in the house."
6124,63-1,"Um, there were the three, old sisters, um, ugly nasty old sisters, um, not her sisters,."
6125,63-1,but I think they were sisters among them.
6126,63-1,"And then there was a dance that came to the, um, sisters were getting ready for the dance and , um, all of a sudden, for some reason, um, Cinderella was also able to go to the dance, um."
6127,63-1,"And she, I think she danced with the prince when she was at the dance,."
6128,63-1,"and when she was leaving the dance, the prince fell in love with her."
6129,63-1,"and when she was leaving the dance, her shoe fell off."
6130,63-1,"And so the only way that think, I think the prince could find her was with the shoe."
6131,63-1,So I think they came to her house.
6132,63-1,"and um said, who does the shoe fit."
6133,63-1,"and it fits Cinderella, so they lived happily ever."
6134,27-1,"OK, this is Cinderella, poor Cinderella, her, um."
6135,27-1,Her mom died probably giving birth to her.
6136,27-1,Her dad.
6137,27-1,"Um, her dad remarried the evil stepmother who came with the two children of two daughters of her own."
6138,27-1,"OK, so Cinderella, um, the reason it's Cinderella, she's always full of cider, she's always dark."
6139,27-1,"She's, she's used as a maid at the house, OK?"
6140,27-1,"And The sisters and the mother are really cruel to her,."
6141,27-1,and they essentially use her as a maid.
6142,27-1,So the prince is back.
6143,27-1,and there's a big ball being planned.
6144,27-1,and all of the eligible single women in the area are being encouraged to come.
6145,27-1,"and Cinderella thinks she's going to be able to come,."
6146,27-1,but now the evil stepmother locks her in her room.
6147,27-1,or pretty much says.
6148,27-1,Forget it.
6149,27-1,"By the way, she had uh little birdies and little uh animals that love her, they're always around her."
6150,27-1,So she's crying.
6151,27-1,"and a fairy godmother comes along and um And , and ,."
6152,27-1,and the mice uh become a pumpkin becomes the carrot and the mice are the horses.
6153,27-1,"or I don't know which or which,."
6154,27-1,but off she goes.
6155,27-1,and she has beautiful gown.
6156,27-1,and uh she's.
6157,27-1,"and uh she goes to the ball, of course, she's uh and the, and the uh glass slippers she's wearing."
6158,27-1,"And so she goes to the ball,."
6159,27-1,but at midnight she's been told everything will revert back so she better um move her butt before midnight.
6160,27-1,"And uh so she's at the ball, of course, she."
6161,27-1,and the prince immediately connect.
6162,27-1,and they're dancing.
6163,27-1,and uh I remember the prince's father is looking on.
6164,27-1,"She ain't royalty though, at any rate, um."
6165,27-1,So she gets lost in the time.
6166,27-1,and pretty soon she looks and it's almost midnight.
6167,27-1,So she has to run.
6168,27-1,and she drops one of the glass slippers on the steps.
6169,27-1,"and she gets in the carriage and , you know, they're off."
6170,27-1,and pretty soon they don't even make it back.
6171,27-1,before everything turns back to pumpkins and mice and birds and whatever.
6172,27-1,"Um, so she's back at the house."
6173,27-1,"Family doesn't know if she's ever been there um at the ball, but everybody's like, who is that beautiful woman that the prince is so in love with."
6174,27-1,So the prince has to search now with the glass slipper.
6175,27-1,"He needs to find the foot that fits in the glass slipper,."
6176,27-1,and of course he goes everywhere.
6177,27-1,and everybody's trying to shove their feet in.
6178,27-1,and comes to her house.
6179,27-1,"and the sisters both tried desperately, doesn't work."
6180,27-1,And uh they're about to leave.
6181,27-1,and somebody notices.
6182,27-1,"and , you know, there's, there are several different versions so the one I just saw is not animated."
6183,27-1,So that's the one I sort of remember the best.
6184,27-1,I'm not sure.
6185,27-1,whether they see her through a window.
6186,27-1,she's locked in her room.
6187,27-1,"or how it happens,."
6188,27-1,"but they put, you know,."
6189,27-1,"but they, they see her."
6190,27-1,"There's a lot of anxiety that they won't,."
6191,27-1,but they see her.
6192,27-1,"They put the slipper on her foot, it fits,."
6193,27-1,and uh they sort of live happily ever after.
6194,27-1,"She's not particularly vindictive, not as vindictive as I would have been towards the uh stepmother and the stepsisters, um."
6195,232-1,OK.
6196,232-1,Cinderella was a young girl.
6197,232-1,And the mother passed away.
6198,232-1,and she was living with her father.
6199,232-1,"Uh, the father remarried."
6200,232-1,"and um the new, the stepmother had two daughters, and they were very jealous of Cinderella because she was very, very beautiful."
6201,232-1,"and they mistreated her, and she was um Not part of the family."
6202,232-1,She was staying in with the animals.
6203,232-1,and having no really place uh in the activities with the rest of the family.
6204,232-1,"In the kingdom, there was um a prince."
6205,232-1,"that was giving a big party, a big ball for to get him."
6206,232-1,A princess to marry the princess.
6207,232-1,So the stepmother.
6208,232-1,"and the stepsisters were getting ready to go to the ball and with beautiful dresses, dresses,."
6209,232-1,and the Cinderella was not allowed to go.
6210,232-1,She was very sad and um.
6211,232-1,"because she had a she had a dress and was ready to go,."
6212,232-1,but she was not allowed.
6213,232-1,The fairy came.
6214,232-1,"and gave her a dress and a courage, and Cinderella is able to go to the, to the ball,."
6215,232-1,"but the magic would last until 12, so she has to come back to the house before midnight."
6216,232-1,"She goes to the ball, she dance with the, with the prince."
6217,232-1,"And when the bell start uh striking 12, she's running, leaving the ball."
6218,232-1,And she's Running.
6219,232-1,"and one of the glass shoes er fell,."
6220,232-1,that she continues running.
6221,232-1,and get to the house.
6222,232-1,"before all the magic disappeared and she's back to be the poor girl, uh without the beautiful dress or the beautiful carriage."
6223,232-1,"Um, the prince found the, the glass shoe and um."
6224,232-1,Or there is.
6225,232-1,To look for the girl.
6226,232-1,And they try different people to see.
6227,232-1,if they fit the shoe fit.
6228,232-1,and um they found that Cinderella is the one.
6229,232-1,"that lost the, the shoe."
6230,232-1,"So, the prince uh Met her."
6231,232-1,and they are married and happily ever after.
6232,66-1,"OK, so Cinderella's mother must have died at a young age,."
6233,66-1,"cause the father is presenting his daughter to this woman he's gonna marry who has two little girls, and those two little girls are not happy with Cinderella being Part of the family."
6234,66-1,But the mother is spoiled.
6235,66-1,"and she gets what she wants,."
6236,66-1,"and we don't see the father anymore in the picture, or in the book story actually."
6237,66-1,"Um, Cinderellas turns out to be there."
6238,66-1,Stepsister.
6239,66-1,"that she becomes their maid, they boss her around."
6240,66-1,She has to serve them this.
6241,66-1,and clean the house.
6242,66-1,and she's not treated well.
6243,66-1,"She's treated like a servant,."
6244,66-1,"and she's put in some little room with a bed,."
6245,66-1,that 's it.
6246,66-1,"So she makes friends with the mice and they friends with her, and then."
6247,66-1,"as the kids get older, the the king wants to have a party."
6248,66-1,"and bring all the wonderful young ladies to the house to the palace, so his son, the prince can find a bride."
6249,66-1,"So the girls are all excited, they're gonna go."
6250,66-1,"and Cinderella has the Wash their hair, take care of them, make sure their dress is perfect,."
6251,66-1,and then she gets dressed up.
6252,66-1,and wants to go.
6253,66-1,"and they say, oh no, you can't go, you're just a maid."
6254,66-1,You can't go at all.
6255,66-1,"So she's sad, she goes to her room."
6256,66-1,and she's reading this book.
6257,66-1,"I'm not sure what the book tells her, but then The stepsisters."
6258,66-1,and the mother go to the palace.
6259,66-1,"And they're presented at the palace,."
6260,66-1,"like everybody else is,."
6261,66-1,and they're introduced to the king and the prince.
6262,66-1,"And Cinderella is sitting at home,."
6263,66-1,and then a fairy godmother comes up.
6264,66-1,"and says, well, you go."
6265,66-1,"So she gets um she has to get a dress, so she has a dress, the birds bring something."
6266,66-1,"and she has a dress,."
6267,66-1,"and they get a pumpkin,."
6268,66-1,"and the mice, the pumpkinkin turns into the carriage."
6269,66-1,"and the mice turns into the horses, and I'm not sure who becomes the."
6270,66-1,The one.
6271,66-1,that drives the horse and carriage.
6272,66-1,"But anyway, Cinderella goes to the party, and she's the last one there, so everybody is looking at her."
6273,66-1,"as she comes down the stairs,."
6274,66-1,"and everybody's amazed at how beautiful she is, what a gorgeous dress she has on,."
6275,66-1,"and the prince is like , oh my God, love at first sight."
6276,66-1,So he goes.
6277,66-1,"and asks her to dance,."
6278,66-1,and he seems.
6279,66-1,like he just wants to dance with her all night.
6280,66-1,And then she realizes she has to be back by the strike before the the the um.
6281,66-1,The clock strikes 12.
6282,66-1,"because she has to get home,."
6283,66-1,"and she hears the chimes starting, so she goes, I'm sorry, I have to go,."
6284,66-1,"and she runs out, drops one of her slippers on the steps, gets on the sidewalk,."
6285,66-1,"and all of a sudden her clothes become her rags again,."
6286,66-1,and she runs home.
6287,66-1,And she pretends like she wasn't there.
6288,66-1,"and the sisters come in chatting and oh here was this girl that was so beautiful,."
6289,66-1,"and she took our places, we couldn't dance with the prince, and they were so upset, just jealous girls."
6290,66-1,"So she just kept quiet, did what she had to do, clean up, serve them food or whatever."
6291,66-1,And then the prince decided.
6292,66-1,"He was in love that woman,."
6293,66-1,"that girl, so he was, he got the."
6294,66-1,"The glass slipper,."
6295,66-1,and he said to his coach.
6296,66-1,and we're gonna go around.
6297,66-1,and we're gonna see who it fits and the the person.
6298,66-1,that fits into the glass slipper will become my bride.
6299,66-1,So they go around.
6300,66-1,and then they go to her house.
6301,66-1,And uh They try to fit the slipper all even the mother.
6302,66-1,"And the sisters, nothing fits,."
6303,66-1,"and then they they're saying, you have somebody else here."
6304,66-1,"and they're going, no, no, we just have a servant."
6305,66-1,"Well, the servant has to try the slipper on also."
6306,66-1,So the servant tried to slipper on.
6307,66-1,and it fit.
6308,66-1,and they're looking at her.
6309,66-1,How did you get there?
6310,66-1,"Whoa, who blah blah blah, whatever."
6311,66-1,And then they live happily ever after.
6312,88-1,"remarried, well, she So Cinderella now had a stepmother,."
6313,88-1,and she also had uh two stepsisters.
6314,88-1,Who entered the house and uh.

6316,88-1,that they were quite demanding.
6317,88-1,And they um picked on Cinderella and uh.
6318,88-1,And they just had her do the work around the house and uh was she was really quite a kept person.
6319,88-1,And they called her Cinderella.
6320,88-1,because all she did was uh uh sweep up the cinders and then do.

6590,78-1,The next morning that the prince was just really sad.
6591,78-1,"He couldn't find her, didn't know who she was, didn't know who this lady was, so he, he went, made a hunt through the entire village, trying this uh slipper on all of the All the young women, of course, no one, it didn't fit anyone."
6592,78-1,Finally got to Cinderella's house.
6593,78-1,"The stepsisters tried it on, it didn't fit them,."

6599,59-1,"Once upon a time, There was a father and a daughter."
6600,59-1,"The daughter's mother had died,."
6601,59-1,but the father fell in love with another woman who had 2 daughters.
6602,59-1,And they were married.
6603,59-1,The two daughters couldn't stand poor Cinderella.
6604,59-1,And the stepmother was even nastier.
6605,59-1,Cinderella began to have to do all the chores around the house.
6606,59-1,She was so unhappy.
6607,59-1,Her father apparently didn't notice any of this.
6608,59-1,"She made friends with some of the animals, particularly the little mice who loved her."
6609,59-1,And then one day there was a great announcement.
6610,59-1,The king.
6611,59-1,and the queen were going to give up all.
6612,59-1,"They were going to introduce their son, the prince, to all of the available women in the town."
6613,59-1,So the nasty stepdaughters started getting ready.
6614,59-1,"and planning what they were gonna wear,."
6615,59-1,and they had full support of their mother.
6616,59-1,while Cinderella yearned to be able to go to the ball.
6617,59-1,She really inside knew it would probably never happen.
6618,59-1,"But one day,."
6619,59-1,"as she was doing her chores, all of a sudden, a sparkling woman appeared before her."
6620,59-1,And it turned out it was her fairy godmother.
6621,59-1,"And her fairy godmother said to her, Cinderella, don't worry, you are going to go to the ball."
6622,59-1,So.
6623,59-1,as she continued her chores.
6624,59-1,"and trying to get along with the stepsisters, to no avail, the days passed."
6625,59-1,and the day arrived for the king and queen's ball.
6626,59-1,The stepsisters left.
6627,59-1,Cinderella was still in her room crying.
6628,59-1,And the fairy godmother appeared.
6629,59-1,"And with a couple of Wisps of her wand, Cinderella herself still became looked like a princess."
6630,59-1,"And then The fairy godmother whisped her wand again,."
6631,59-1,and a pumpkin appeared.
6632,59-1,And it was turned into a coach.
6633,59-1,"And the mice, they became beautiful horses to pull the coach,."
6634,59-1,"and Cinderella, Cinderella got into the coach,."
6635,59-1,and she was driven to the ball.
6636,59-1,"When she arrived into the great hall, there was a great silence,."
6637,59-1,because all of a sudden people noticed this beautiful young woman who had arrived.
6638,59-1,"And the prince for sure noticed,."
6639,59-1,and he went over to Cinderella.
6640,59-1,"and asked her to dance,."
6641,59-1,"and the two stepsisters stood in the background,."
6642,59-1,and they murmured about who this woman was.
6643,59-1,and why the prince was no longer paying any attention to them.
6644,59-1,So the prince.
6645,59-1,"and Cinderella danced the evening away,."
6646,59-1,"but Cinderella had been told she had to be back by midnight,."
6647,59-1,"or all of her clothes were turned back into what she had been,."
6648,59-1,and the coach would become a pumpkin again.
6649,59-1,Suddenly the clock began to chime.
6650,59-1,"and Cinderella realized, oh my goodness, it's midnight."
6651,59-1,"I must leave,."
6652,59-1,"and she fled from the prince,."
6653,59-1,"as she was going down the steps, she lost one of her glass slippers."
6654,59-1,"The prince kept shouting, No, no, don't go, don't go."
6655,59-1,But Cinderella knew better when she got into the coach.
6656,59-1,and off she went to her home.
6657,59-1,"Well then, here was the prince,."
6658,59-1,"and he had this beautiful glass slipper,."
6659,59-1,and he knew.
6660,59-1,"if he could find who had worn the glass slipper,."
6661,59-1,that he would find the woman who would be the love of his life.
6662,59-1,that he would one day marry.
6663,59-1,So he went around the town from house to house.
6664,59-1,"And when he got to Cinderella's house, the two stepsisters came out,."
6665,59-1,"and they tried very, very hard."
6666,59-1,To put on the glass slipper.
6667,59-1,"And the prince asked, is there anybody else here?"
6668,59-1,"And they said, oh no, no, no, no, no, there's no one else here."
6669,59-1,"But somehow Cinderella piqued her little head around the door,."
6670,59-1,"and he said, Wait, I see a lovely young woman."
6671,59-1,And Cinderella came forward.
6672,59-1,And guess what?
6673,59-1,The glass slipper fit her.
6674,59-1,"She put on the glass slipper,."
6675,59-1,and there was great rejoicing.
6676,59-1,"And the prince took her off,."
6677,59-1,and they lived happily ever after.

6959,95-1,and lost one of her shoes.
6960,95-1,"Uh, so, The prince really wanted to find out who she was."

6990,Baycrest12813,"OK, so Cinderella was."
6991,Baycrest12813,"I think 3 aunts had 3 aunts,."
6992,Baycrest12813,"and they made her do all the work around the house, and her buddies were the little animals, but she was a good sport,."
6993,Baycrest12813,and she did all the work.
6994,Baycrest12813,and had to do wash the floors.
6995,Baycrest12813,and do all that stuff in the cooking.
6996,Baycrest12813,"And then they got in the, the house got an invitation to go to."
6997,Baycrest12813,"I do, uh, dance."
6998,Baycrest12813,And so they all went.
6999,Baycrest12813,"And then when they were there, she danced with the prince charming,."
7000,Baycrest12813,"and they had a good time,."
7001,Baycrest12813,"but for some reason, which I can't remember, she had to leave, so she rushed out."
7002,Baycrest12813,She left the shoe behind.
7003,Baycrest12813,"Well, the prince really loved her, he went looking for her, so whoever could wear the shoe was the gal."
7004,Baycrest12813,Which really doesn't make sense.
7005,Baycrest12813,You should be able to look at her.
7006,Baycrest12813,"But anyways, the shoes, the gimmick that that identifies the gal."
7007,Baycrest12813,And the 3 ants try on the shoe.
7008,Baycrest12813,"and To their dismay, it doesn't fit,."
7009,Baycrest12813,"and then they put it on Cinderella's foot,."
7010,Baycrest12813,"and it fits,."
7011,Baycrest12813,and she runs off.
7012,Baycrest12813,"and marries the prince,."
7013,Baycrest12813,and everybody lives happily ever after.
7014,17-1,"So I guess Cinderella lived with her wicked stepmom and stepsisters, half sisters, whatever they were, um,."
7015,17-1,and they always made her do the work and um.
7016,17-1,"and I believe she went to a, wanted to go to a Party."
7017,17-1,or dance that they were having.
7018,17-1,"and uh the stepsisters said, oh you can't come."
7019,17-1,and um she went anyway.
7020,17-1,"and Then, um, She met the prince there."
7021,17-1,"and he Danced with her,."
7022,17-1,"and didn't dance with the stepsisters,."
7023,17-1,and then um she had to be home by midnight.
7024,17-1,cause she went in that pumpkin little um vehicle that um she had to leave by midnight.
7025,17-1,and she left.
7026,17-1,"and she lost her shoe on away, her slipper, I guess, and ,."
7027,17-1,and the prince found it.
7028,17-1,and then he wanted to know where she went.
7029,17-1,and couldn't find her.
7030,17-1,"and then um Um, he went from house to house."
7031,17-1,"and he found her,."
7032,17-1,and they were reunited and happy ever after.
7033,17-1,That's short story.
7034,17-1,"Thank you, condensed version."
7035,33-1,"Uh, Cinderella was a young lady."
7036,33-1,that lived with um a stepmother and 3 stepsisters.
7037,33-1,"And she was a very sweet girl,."
7038,33-1,and they took advantage of her.
7039,33-1,They were not nice to her.
7040,33-1,"Um, the mother favored her own three daughters, but she was mean to Cinderella."
7041,33-1,and made her do.
7042,33-1,All kinds.
7043,33-1,"of Jobs around the house that were not fun,."
7044,33-1,like scrubbing the floor.
7045,33-1,and carrying heavy things.
7046,33-1,"and Taking care of the other girls and the house, um,."
7047,33-1,but Cinderella always stayed positive.
7048,33-1,and tried to do what she was told.
7049,33-1,"Um, Do you want me to tell what the good fortune?"
7050,33-1,that Cinderella had?
7051,33-1,As far.
7052,33-1,as you wanna go.
7053,33-1,OK.
7054,33-1,"So, Um, the story ends happily."
7055,33-1,that The girls were invited to a uh A ball at the at the castle.
7056,33-1,"and um Cinderella really wanted to go,."
7057,33-1,"but they, you know, the mom got them these beautiful dresses."
7058,33-1,and got them all dressed up and everything um.
7059,33-1,and Cinderella was wishing so badly she could go and then um.
7060,33-1,"Her fairy godmother came along, and the little mice."
7061,33-1,"in her room helped to make her a beautiful ball gown,."
7062,33-1,and um she ended up going to the ball and dancing with the prince.
7063,33-1,"And the only thing she had to remember was at the strike of 12 o'clock, she had to leave."
7064,33-1,"So when she heard the clock strike 12, she ran down the steps of the castle to run home."
7065,33-1,because her dress was gonna turn back into her tattered clothes.
7066,33-1,and she wouldn't have a way home.
7067,33-1,"And then a few days later, the prince came around looking for this beautiful girl."
7068,33-1,that he got to dance with.
7069,33-1,"It was Cinderella,."
7070,33-1,but nobody else knew.
7071,33-1,"that Um, And his way."
7072,33-1,of finding her was.
7073,33-1,by bringing a glass shoe.
7074,33-1,and trying it on.
7075,33-1,All the young ladies in the kingdom.
7076,33-1,and the three stepsisters tried so hard to get their foot into the shoe.
7077,33-1,"and they couldn't,."
7078,33-1,"and finally, um, the prince wanted to put it on Cinderella's foot."
7079,33-1,"and the mother said, oh well, it wouldn't be her,."
7080,33-1,and they laughed.
7081,33-1,and Then they found out.
7082,33-1,"that the shoe actually fit,."
7083,33-1,"and Cinderella ended up marrying the prince,."
7084,33-1,and they lived happily ever after.
7085,75-1,"Cinderella was A member of a family,."
7086,75-1,and she had 2 sisters.
7087,75-1,"The two sisters, uh, typically were jealous of Cinderella."
7088,75-1,and tried to keep her.
7089,75-1,From having any benefits.
7090,75-1,that they had in the family.
7091,75-1,So they conspired against Cinderella continually.
7092,75-1,And uh There was a A family get together where a handsome prince was going to visit.
7093,75-1,And uh the two sisters.
7094,75-1,"Uh, conspired again."
7095,75-1,and tried to keep Cinderella.
7096,75-1,from meeting the handsome prince.
7097,75-1,"So, the uh The prince came and Left."
7098,75-1,And Cinderella didn't get a chance to make herself known to the prince.
7099,75-1,"But the French, uh, Saw Cinderella."
7100,75-1,as he was visiting the family.
7101,75-1,And He decided he wanted to get together with her.
7102,75-1,and meet her.
7103,75-1,"And So,."
7104,75-1,"in order to make a choice, Between the the daughters, he uh he was given."
7105,75-1,A magic slipper.
7106,75-1,By a fairy godmother.
7107,75-1,that had been involved somehow.
7108,75-1,In the family and uh The The idea was.
7109,75-1,that the prince would would uh marry.
7110,75-1,Whichever sister.
7111,75-1,Fit The glass slipper.
7112,75-1,And they tried it on.
7113,75-1,And the one.
7114,75-1,that it fit.
7115,75-1,"He tried it on the sisters, and the one that it fit was Cinderella."
7116,75-1,"So, He Oh, Married Cinderella."
7117,75-1,Much to the fairy godmother's liking.
7118,58-1,OK.
7119,58-1,"Well, Cinderella uh was being taken advantage of."
7120,58-1,And uh she was required to do all of the work around the house where the other two daughters of the uh woman uh were living a life of luxury.
7121,58-1,Cinderella was bearing the brunt of all of that and she was not in a very happy environment.
7122,58-1,and a uh A ball was gonna be held.
7123,58-1,"and Cinderella would have absolutely loved to go, but her two stepsisters."
7124,58-1,"We're going to the ball and not her,."
7125,58-1,and she had to get everything ready for then she had to do all the preparation.
7126,58-1,"and she just did not like what was going on, but she was obedient, so she did what she had to do."
7127,58-1,"And then when uh the two stepsisters were getting ready, Cinderella."
7128,58-1,had an opportunity to attend the ball.
7129,58-1,She uh was given by her fairy godmother an opportunity.
7130,58-1,"and uh they got very good clothing for her, a beautiful dress."
7131,58-1,She had a carriage.
7132,58-1,that came to her house to pick her up.
7133,58-1,"that was formerly a pumpkin turned into a carriage,."
7134,58-1,"and off she went to the ball,."
7135,58-1,but she was told.
7136,58-1,"that she had to be home by midnight, otherwise, everything."
7137,58-1,that was being done for her would reverse itself and she was At the ball.
7138,58-1,"and the clock started striking midnight, so she was running to get to the carriage to get back home,."
7139,58-1,and she lost one of her uh shoes.
7140,58-1,"And When the ball was over, Cinderella went back to her home."
7141,58-1,The princes of the uh of the territory.
7142,58-1,"that she lived in was so enamored with her,."
7143,58-1,but he didn't know anything about her.
7144,58-1,All he found was a uh a shoe.
7145,58-1,And what he did was he went throughout the area trying to shoot on with the uh hope.
7146,58-1,"that whoever's foot would, it would fit into, he would be able to meet."
7147,58-1,and uh continue on with her in a relationship.
7148,58-1,"And she came, uh, when, when he came to her house, the, uh, stepmother wanted, of course, her two daughters to be tried,."
7149,58-1,"and the shoe wouldn't fit,."
7150,58-1,"and they He said, what about Kind of display I downplayed it and uh."
7151,58-1,but he persisted.
7152,58-1,"and she tried to to slip around, it fit perfectly."
7153,58-1,and they lived happily ever after.
7154,55-1,"Um, yes, Cinderella was had this, um, young lady who was She just worked around the house."
7155,55-1,She was not.
7156,55-1,"Very well taken care of, I guess,."
7157,55-1,"because she was not, she was probably on the poor side."
7158,55-1,"Um, anyway, she, she knew."
7159,55-1,that this big ball was coming.
7160,55-1,"and she was all doing all the work for all the, the um the people."
7161,55-1,that her she was caring for.
7162,55-1,"and , you know, making sure their shoes fit in and their dresses."
7163,55-1,and doing this.
7164,55-1,"and doing that , and all the little little intricacies of it."
7165,55-1,"And um the night of the ball, they came, uh, it came and she was in her room looking out the window,."
7166,55-1,"and she had this, she had this dream."
7167,55-1,"that she was going to be able to kind of like a dream,."
7168,55-1,but I guess it was more of a wish.
7169,55-1,that she wanted to be there.
7170,55-1,and the good fairy came.
7171,55-1,and gave her her wish come true.
7172,55-1,She got this beautiful dress.
7173,55-1,"that they, you know, the dress was all put up on the, the um."
7174,55-1,Dresser.
7175,55-1,and hanging there.
7176,55-1,and she got dressed and she was all gorgeous.
7177,55-1,She went down to the ball.
7178,55-1,and I don't think.
7179,55-1,that people really recognized her at first.
7180,55-1,because she was not looking.
7181,55-1,"like Cinderella was looking, she was looking like a princess and she was gorgeous, and um."
7182,55-1,"As it turns out, she ends up marrying the handsome prince and all the other other women there were there to get him,."
7183,55-1,and none of them got them but her.
7184,55-1,So there's the story of Cinderella.
7185,31-1,"Uh, is, uh, uh, is, is stuck with a wicked stepmother,."
7186,31-1,"and it's also the stepmothers is, is favors her daughter,."
7187,31-1,"so the, the, uh, the stepmother's daughter doesn't get doesn't have to do any chores,."
7188,31-1,and Cinderella is forced.
7189,31-1,"To do all the chores, all the manual labor around the house, uh,."
7190,31-1,"and , um, Um, without any, any assistance, he's, that gets no, uh, Um, no feedback or no positive feedback from the stepmother, uh, uh,."
7191,31-1,"and has basically a, uh, uh, uh, a miserable, you know, a miserable life,."
7192,31-1,"but she, uh, she, she doesn't take it that way."
7193,31-1,"She just, um, she, she does what she does the chores without complaint,."
7194,31-1,"but she dreams of, uh, of a, of an escape."
7195,31-1,"Uh, in, in some fashion."
7196,31-1,Do I need to go into how eventually she meets the prince?
7197,31-1,and uh winds up uh the princess?
7198,31-1,Whatever you want to tell me.
7199,31-1,"OK, well, yeah, eventually there's a ball, she uh she uh finds uh um uh."
7200,31-1,"so there's some enchanted, it could either be an enchanted frog or a fairy godmother that comes."
7201,31-1,"and uh allows her, you know, changes her."
7202,31-1,"so she has clothes to go to the ball, where naturally the handsome prince falls in love with her."
7203,31-1,And uh.
7204,31-1,but she uh only has until midnight uh to uh uh to to keep the the fine dress and everything.
7205,31-1,"She has to be home by midnight,."
7206,31-1,so she runs but uh but uh.
7207,31-1,as she's leaving the uh the uh the glass slipper.
7208,31-1,"Uh, uh, uh, uh, you know, falls off, so that's the only thing that's left to identify her."
7209,31-1,"The prince goes throughout the, uh, uh, the, the, the, the town or the country, whatever it is,."
7210,31-1,"and , uh, searching for, uh, for the, uh, um, the, the woman who's who who's fit, whose foot fits the, uh, the missing shoe."
7211,31-1,Eventually they stumble on on Cinderella's house.
7212,31-1,"They're trying to, you know, they um the the the wicked stepmother."
7213,31-1,"and the uh the stepdaughter, the the the daughters uh try not to let her see,."
7214,31-1,"but the the prince sees her, puts the foot, the slip, the slipper on, it fits and uh so then Cinderella."
7215,31-1,and the prince live happily ever after.
7216,71-1,Yeah.
7217,71-1,"All right, Cinderella."
7218,71-1,and her father live alone in their castle.
7219,71-1,It looks like they're financially pretty well off.
7220,71-1,"Um, Her father meets a woman who has two daughters of her own,."
7221,71-1,and he wants he introduces his daughter to her.
7222,71-1,and decides.
7223,71-1,that they're gonna get married.
7224,71-1,and become a new family.
7225,71-1,"And when they do, looks like mom is not too seriously interested in Cinderella from the get-go."
7226,71-1,"Um,."
7227,71-1,"and then dad apparently dies, which leaves mom or stepmother in charge of the planet."
7228,71-1,that Cinderella lives in with her two step stepsisters.
7229,71-1,"Uh, she's made to do a lot of scullery type duties around the house,."
7230,71-1,"and she doesn't seem to mind it too much, uh,."
7231,71-1,but she has friends.
7232,71-1,and she likes to read.
7233,71-1,Our friends are within the castle or her animals.
7234,71-1,"that apparently pay attention to her enough to give her some companionship, um."
7235,71-1,One day the prince.
7236,71-1,"and his entourage are, are prince is having some kind of ball of some sort."
7237,71-1,"His parents want him to get married, I suspect,."
7238,71-1,and to meet somebody.
7239,71-1,that everybody is invited who is anybody in the area.
7240,71-1,"Um, they're all dressed up."
7241,71-1,"They all wanna meet the prince, they all would."
7242,71-1,"like to marry the prince for obvious reasons, um."
7243,71-1,Cinderella does not expect to go.
7244,71-1,She has nothing to wear.
7245,71-1,"But she has a fairy godmother, unbeknownst to her, who animates these friends of hers, these little animals."
7246,71-1,and doing certain roles within the um which are necessary.
7247,71-1,"in order to get Cinderella to the ball in style,."
7248,71-1,so she can draw some attention to herself.
7249,71-1,"I don't know that 's her plan or stepmom's plan, and I'm sorry, her plan or the uh um."
7250,71-1,"Tell you who it is, what is her role, the witch, not the witch, um, fairy godmother."
7251,71-1,I don't remember what she was before.
7252,71-1,"Um, maybe she's always just a fairy godmother."
7253,71-1,"So she ends up with a very beautiful dress, beautiful shoes, shoes are very important, um, also."
7254,71-1,"A coach with horses and livery, a very old world entrance to the ball,."
7255,71-1,and she goes to the ball.
7256,71-1,and she meets the prince.
7257,71-1,"They do dance, uh,."
7258,71-1,but she was told also.
7259,71-1,that everything will change back at the stroke of midnight.
7260,71-1,"so all of a sudden, you know, she's kind of forgotten the time."
7261,71-1,"I'm very sympathetic with that , and The bell or the chime."
7262,71-1,"or whatever starts to ring, she realized what's gonna happen,."
7263,71-1,"so she starts running, the prince runs after her."
7264,71-1,"She loses one of her shoes, the prince finds the shoes, prince."
7265,71-1,"and his entourage again, go out looking, forget the other one, go out looking for who matches the shoe."
7266,71-1,It is a glass slipper.
7267,71-1,"so there's not a lot of give in this story for that shoe,."
7268,71-1,and eventually they find Cinderella.
7269,71-1,And they live happily everywhere because it is a Walt Disney Cinderella.
7270,21-1,OK.
7271,21-1,Cinderella was a wealthy young woman growing up with a father.
7272,21-1,that loved her very much.
7273,21-1,and her mother had died.
7274,21-1,"When the dad got remarried, it drastically changed her life when uh the new mother, the stepmother moved in with her two nasty daughters, and they probably weren't very interested in the dad, they just wanted his money."
7275,21-1,And they started to use Cinderella as their servant.
7276,21-1,Do you want me to continue with the rest of the story?
7277,21-1,"Yes, please."
7278,21-1,OK.
7279,21-1,"And then, um, she's out one day."
7280,21-1,and she sees the handsome prince.
7281,21-1,and sort of falls in love.
7282,21-1,"with him, is fascinated with him,."
7283,21-1,and he gets a look at her.
7284,21-1,"and wants to see more of her,."
7285,21-1,but she is pretty much locked up in the house.
7286,21-1,So he announces.
7287,21-1,that he's gonna have a a ball.
7288,21-1,"And have all the women, all the young women in the town."
7289,21-1,and the country comes.
7290,21-1,"that he can see them all, and they're all very excited,."
7291,21-1,"and the mother-in-law stepmother gets them all, uh, take care of daughters who are very homely, all dressed up."
7292,21-1,"and doing the best she can do for them, and poor Cinderella, who's locked up in the attic."
7293,21-1,And uh can't get out to get a dress.
7294,21-1,"or go to the pool, has all her little friends."
7295,21-1,"that she's made friends with the mice and the birds and all,."
7296,21-1,and they all make a very beautiful dress for her to wear and uh.
7297,21-1,They make a coach to take her to the to the ball.
7298,21-1,"So she travels to the ball, but what she knows is."
7299,21-1,that she has to be home by the stroke of midnight.
7300,21-1,because everything will change back to what it was.
7301,21-1,"The pet dogs will, whoever they are, mice will turn back into mice instead of the horses,."
7302,21-1,and the horseman will change back into whatever type of animal he was.
7303,21-1,before the story started.
7304,21-1,So she goes to the ball.
7305,21-1,and he uh dances.
7306,21-1,"and he sees her,."
7307,21-1,"and they start to get together and it's midnight,."
7308,21-1,so she has to run off.
7309,21-1,One of her slippers falls off.
7310,21-1,So now he has her crystal slipper.
7311,21-1,So he's determined to find whoever in the coun in country.
7312,21-1,Foot could fit into this.
7313,21-1,So they have Cinderella locked up in.
7314,21-1,while he's coming around to their house.
7315,21-1,The ugly stepsisters try to cram their feet into it.
7316,21-1,"and I obviously can't get them in,."
7317,21-1,and she's she's locked up in the castle.
7318,21-1,And I can't remember the right ending how.
7319,21-1,How she ends up getting down.
7320,21-1,It has to have something to do.
7321,21-1,with the mice getting the key.
7322,21-1,"and letting her out, I think."
7323,21-1,And uh.
7324,21-1,"so she runs down, they slipper fits."
7325,21-1,and she ends up getting married.
7326,21-1,and being happily married forever and ever.
7327,BMN3031b,"The mean, terrible."
7328,BMN3031b,"A woman who has two really bad, bad kids."
7329,BMN3031b,are starting to Get mad.
7330,BMN3031b,because She gets to go.
7331,BMN3031b,And want to go to the Party.
7332,BMN3031b,that they're having.
7333,BMN3031b,"And the main, main lady."
7334,BMN3031b,doesn't want her to go at all.
7335,BMN3031b,"So, They sit down."
7336,BMN3031b,and they're playing.
7337,BMN3031b,And she's working very hard.
7338,BMN3031b,And cleaning everything.
7339,BMN3031b,Washing the floor.
7340,BMN3031b,And then there's a knock on the door.
7341,BMN3031b,"And the mean, mean lady."
7342,BMN3031b,Opens up the door.
7343,BMN3031b,And lo.
7344,BMN3031b,"and behold, They all got dressed up to go and she was not able to go."
7345,BMN3031b,She was sitting there looking.
7346,BMN3031b,and watching.

7423,64-1,and she came down the steps.
7424,64-1,"and he tried it on her foot,."

7426,68-1,"Cinderella is a young woman who is um I guess she's orphaned and she's a stepchild with two other sisters who are Um, Who's who the mother is actually their mother, but her stepmother."
7427,68-1,"And She is, um, basically forced to um do the housework."

7444,68-1,"The 3 the two sisters are gonna go,."
7445,68-1,but steps um daughter is is supposed to stay home.
7446,68-1,And she has a fairy godmother.
7447,68-1,or meets her fairy godmother who um.
7448,68-1,who casts a spell for her.
7449,68-1,because she doesn't have any um any of the entrapments.
7450,68-1,that she would need to go to a ball.
7451,68-1,"So this, the fairy godmother um provides uh turns a pumpkin into a carriage."
